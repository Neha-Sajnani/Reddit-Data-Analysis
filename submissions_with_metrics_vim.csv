-----------------

[Zepl.vim][] is a lightweight REPL integration package for Vim. It provides commands to start and jump to a running REPL, as well as commands and key bindings to send text to the REPL.

[Zepl.vim][] follows several design philosophies:

1. Should be easy to use and configure: not much to learn and very few configuration options.
2. Feel like a part of Vim. Key bindings and commands should work just like the built-in ones.
3. Tiny implementation. (Must not exceed 200 LOC; currently under 160 lines of code.)

There are a couple of known limitations:

- Only 1 REPL can be open at a time (per Vim instance).
- `set hidden` is required for Neovim and will be automatically set.

The pattern needs to match a comma delimited list that can have both singly quoted fields and embedded (doubled) single quotes.

The pattern in question is:

    let s:pattern = '\m\%(^\|,\)\%(\s*\%([^''][^,]*\)\|\%(''\%(''''\|[^'']\)*''\)\s*\%(,\|$\)\)\@='

The crux of the issue seems to come down to choosing one of the following two inner branches to match either a field that is not quoted, or one that is:

    [^''][^,]*

and:

    ''\%(''''\|[^'']\)*''

If I use only one of these sub-patterns I'm able to match successfully, however combining the two seems to fail for some reason. I've tried every variety of lookaround I can think of to no avail. At this point, I'm ready to give up using an expression and switch to a pushdown automaton.

Considering that im having trouble at this stage should i just quit on Vim, and keep on using VS code? Atom also seems viable and has a guide on the setup on youtube so thats also something im considering.

Short term goals:

1. Setup Vim (LaTeX capability, Pdf Viewer)
2. Write LaTeX files in Vim
3. Setup a master preamble that all my .tex files use
4. Setup a good file management for different Courses and Semesters
5. be able do install plugins

Other goals.

1. Write my own snippets (This would be so awesome!)

On my work notebook, nord is completely unusable in putty; and on vlm ssh, the background color only shows under text - whitespace is black. Putty and VLM at home work fine.

This solution has lots of room for improvement: only produce colours for months in use, limit number of colours and chunking dates together, generate nicer sets of colours.

Before I go further, I hoped someone here might know of an existing solution?

I checked some existing plugins:

* Fugitive does something completely different: it tries to [represent hash values as colours](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive/blob/master/autoload/fugitive.vim#L5498-L5516).
* vc.vim doesn't do any different colours.
* [Looks like vcscommand](https://github.com/inkarkat/vcscommand.vim/blob/master/syntax/svnannotate.vim) doesn't do anything fancy.",1582703385.0

For those of you interested in the details, the three parts of this command
are the colon (:), which enters Command-line mode; the q command, which tells
the editor to quit; and the override command modifier (!).
The override command modifier is needed because Vim is reluctant to throw
away changes. If you were to just type "":q"", Vim would display an error
message and refuse to exit:
E37: No write since last change (use ! to override)
By specifying the override, you are in effect telling Vim, ""I know that what
I'm doing looks stupid, but I'm a big boy and really want to do this.""
If you want to continue editing with Vim: The "":e!"" command reloads the
original version of the file.

But adding ! didn't do anything. After entering

> :e $VIMRUNTIME/tutor/tutor!

I got the same error:

> E37: No write since last change (use ! to override)

I've just recently started using vim. I find the duality of operators and motions very intuitive: it feels perfectly sensible that many of the commands I type have the form ""thing I want to do"" plus ""region I wish to be affected"".

However, the :s command, which is used to find one thing and replace it with another, seems to be an exception to this elegant rule. Although I can type ""**d**10j"" to delete a ten-line function, I cannot type ""\*\*:s/foo/bar/\*\*10j"" to replace ""foo"" with ""bar"" in a ten-line function.

As far as I can tell, this is a fairly simple concept. All that vim would need to do is consider strings of the form "":s/.../.../"" to be operators with normal operator grammar.

Why doesn't vim do this?

—

Here are some possible answers I'm anticipating, all of which I would consider excellent as long as they are true:

* ""There is a command that works like that, it's \[blah\]""
* ""There's no good reason. You can make a command that works like that by putting \[blah\] in your .vimrc file.""
* ""It's actually perfectly natural that vim works like that; you only find it mysterious because you're thinking of it all wrong. You're thinking that \[blah\], but instead, you should think...""

—

Edit: I've realized that my question is going to prompt answers of a different kind, as well:

* ""If you want to replace foo with bar in a ten-line function, you can just use \[blah\].""

If you are about to type an answer of this form, then I want to say that I appreciate your desire to help, but this isn't what I'm looking for. Of course there *is* a way to replace foo with bar in a ten-liner; what I'm wondering is why :s is an oddball exception to the rules — why, in other words, do we:

* use **d10j** to delete 10 lines
* use **c10j** to change 10 lines
* use **y10j** to copy 10 lines
* use **gU10j** to make 10 lines upper case
* use **g?10j** to ROT13 encode 10 lines
* ...
* use **:,+10s/foo/bar** to change ""foo"" to ""bar"" in 10 lines?

Why does **10j** appear in all but one of the commands of the form ""do X to 10 lines""?",1582561902.0

So I've started with vim not too long ago ( about a month).  I really enjoy using it, but I want to be able to get more out of it.  I've seen guides online to amp it up, but I just wanted to know more from the community. 

* Does anybody have tips for setting up a .vimrc file? Like, what variables do you set for your files?
* Something I want to learn is how to set up refactoring words.  Kind of like in an IDE. 
* I'm still pretty bad with file traversal in vim. are there any packages worth looking into? Maybe I don't need to install anything. Would setting commands in my .vimrc help me with switching between files or directories?

I'm just really interested in learning more about it and if anybody has the time to throw in their input, it would mean a lot.

fuzzymidget,Madness with fzf.vim and UltiSnips,0.85,False,1582520919.0,13,f8lztu,vim,https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/f8lztu/madness_with_fzfvim_and_ultisnips/,0,"Many of you guys probably read Sam Walladge's [article](https://vimways.org/2019/personal-notetaking-in-vim/) in Vimways for this year, and it was so interesting I decided to do my own take on it (Thanks /u/srwalladge).

What follows is a plugin question, and yes I've read the doc, and yes I posted on the github issues page, but I bet there's someone here who has a lurking mapping or two with the answer.

# What is a Zettelkasten?

Good question.  Read the post above and watch some videos :).  In the most boiled down sense, it's atomic notes with tags and forward/backward links to related notes.

# What are the challenges of a Vim implementation?

Several.  Auto-generation of back links, maintaining a list of tags, a search mechanism to insert relevant links, and some handy expansions and templates to keep it fast.

# Ok so what's the question?
See edit.  Do a completion but pass through whatever the query was if it's not in the list

# Bonus question

I'd like the command in the edit to auto-trigger when you enter the tabstop for entering tags in UltiSnips.  I think that would require a post-complete or post-jump in UltiSnips, but that's not quite right either.  Any ideas?

Thanks in advance!  If/when I get this done, I'll post up the end product and a demo video.

# EDIT  

This is the fzf command I was looking for, no sleep and misplaced comma:

```
inoremap <expr> <c-x><c-z> fzf#vim#complete(fzf#wrap({
    \ 'source': 'cat ~/zettest/ztags','options': '--print-query'}))

* I type something in vim
* hit `Escape` to go to normal mode
* Hit a keyboard combination mapped to a command/function
* Have the entire current line passed as command-line arguments to an external command
* Have the entire current line _replaced_ by the output of the command.

[Here](https://youtu.be/jolcXYdLSAU) is a video demonstrating exactly what I want it to look like. In the video, however, the _entire buffer_ is passed through an external command, the one line is replaced, and the _entire buffer_ is replaced. I just want to read/replace the single line.

The goal is to use snippets, but set values.

For example, this works:

    nnoremap ,html :-1read $HOME/.vim/template.html<CR>

This allows me to add the contents of `template.html` at the location of my cursor by typing `,html` in normal mode. However, I _only_ get the contents of `template.html` -- I can't use any placeholders.

What I'd like to do is type some words on the current line in vim:

    apple banana

press a key combination, and have it replaced with this:

    func apple(s string) string {
        return s + "" banana""
    }

assuming I've written a script that accepts two arguments and places them in a template. For example:

    #!/usr/bin/env python3

    import sys

    template = 'func {0}(s string) string{{\n\treturn s + {1}\n}}'

    print(template.format(sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2]))

So I've finally realized that vi/vim isn't just that text editor that takes hours to figure out how to exit it, but a nice little text editor that ignores the mouse completely for being too time-consuming and doesn't require a GUI.

Also, I love the fact that I can easily remap keys.
It makes me feel I have full control over my editor and
just by using a dvorak keyboard layout I need to rearrange many of the keys.

Now I'd like to use it as an IDE, in particular for a Vue project.
Because I've felt the slow death of other IDE's (Eclipse), meaning that everything I've learnt from them is becoming useless, plus the popularity of an IDE that I both feel is a temporary free-version of a proprietary program made by a Linux competitor as well as question the longetivity of the company behind it as it has always relied on expensive intel computers while we're heading into the age of cheap ARM SoC's, not to mention it failed on the mobile phone market (MS VS). So I want something that I think will be lasting for a much longer time, thus vim. 

## My issues 

So many issues, so many edits.
I keep adding and deleting new issues as it's dawning on me what I really need/want.

### Terminal-buffer does not to tab completion

Is this possible?

### Yanking does not copy to X clipboard.

This would make things a lot easier in my opinion.

## What I have so far

http://vpaste.net/iB2Zl

## [Solved 4 months later]

First, let me say that I've stopped bothering about wanting to switch to new files so quickly,
so I only needed two panes.
For the last four months I've simply used two seperate xfce-terminal windows.

That was until yesterday due to an update that messed with my terminal font.
I got familiar with FiraCode and then Kitty terminal.
Kitty terminal supports tabs and scrolling exactly the way I envisioned it should be.
Now I don't have to use a mouse anymore while programming.",1582474004.0

I currently use vs-code and vim for quick edits, though I have found myself using vim a bit more lately. I've been familiar with vim keys for quite a while, and couldn't really do without them now. 

I'm currently going through a few system related things ( changing BSD to GNU stuff in OSX ), and that has led to me looking at vim installs as a result of the message: 

```
vim: stable 8.2.0250 (bottled), HEAD
Vi 'workalike' with many additional features
https://www.vim.org/
Conflicts with:
  ex-vi (because vim and ex-vi both install bin/ex and bin/view)
  macvim (because vim and macvim both install vi* binaries)
Not installed

That's a bit of context, and to let the reader know that I'm not completely new to vim. What I'm wondering about though is the title - why would I thank someone for using neovim instead? I thought that it (neovim) was meant to support devs more if they wanted to embed vim or something, but I don't really understand what the benefit would be for myself. 

I hope this isn't a classic flamewar type question, it's not intended to be.

Their callbacks `goyo_enter` and `goyo_leave` mentions a few things I don't understand such as...

* What is `User` in the `autocmd! ...` statement mean?

To make things easier for myself I added:

nmap ]] <Plug>VimwikiGoToNextHeader""m'""<C-O>

nmap [[ <Plug>VimwikiGoToPrevHeader""m'""<C-O>

FeetlessColon,Questions about auto-indentation in vim,0.67,False,1582195087.0,1,f60hc1,vim,https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/f60hc1/questions_about_autoindentation_in_vim/,13,"The only setting I've set concerning *auto-indentation* is `set autoindent`(9)^(1), but when I turn it off, the *auto-indentation* is still there. All `:set autoindent?`, `:set smartindent?`, `:set cindent?` say that they're not set, so something else must be causing the *auto-indentation*.

I figured out that *indentexpr* is causing my *auto-indentation*, because when I `:set indentexpr=""""`, the *auto-indentation* is all gone, but I'm not setting it anywhere in my [*vimrc*](https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/9TPt36tZq2/) file.

I've also [read online](https://stackoverflow.com/a/18671756/11943796) that `filetype plugin on`(33) might be causing this, but when I remove it, nothing changes.

After testing a bit, I found, that by removing these lines(35-39) in my [*vimrc*](https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/9TPt36tZq2/) file:

    call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')
        ...
    call plug#end()

The *auto-indentation* is gone! Which must mean, that either my plugins, or my [*vim-plug*](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) is causing the *auto-indentation*. After some further testing, by deleting all the plugins, I debunked the possibility of plugins causing this, so this means, that actually my [*vim-plug*](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) is causing this!

But the thing that bothers me the most is, that with this *auto-indentation*, when I type in <(-CR> in a *python* file, two new indentations are added in a new line, wtf? The reason it bothers me so much, is that my [parentheses auto-completion plugin](https://github.com/cohama/lexima.vim)'s *(I used to use lexima, but it's too much for me)* feature, where <(-CR> should close the parentheses in a new line, with no indentation, instead adds two new indentation lines, in a new line!

As far as I know, no python style-guide allows this, so why would this happen?  Also, in a python file,  `:set verbose indentexpr?` returns `.../vim/vim80/indent/python.vim`, which means that no plugins are interfering with the auto-indentation.

# So my questions are:

* Why is *indentexpr* automatically set in my vim? *\[Answered* [*here*](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/f60hc1/questions_about_autoindentation_in_vim/fi1xbox?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) *by* u/Jorengarenar, *thank you!\]*
* Why doesn't autoindent do anything when *indentexpr* is not set?
* Why does vim-plug cause auto-indentations and how do I tell it not to?
* Why would <(-CR> add two new indentations in a new line? *\[Answered* [*here*](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/f60hc1/questions_about_autoindentation_in_vim/fi214kl?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)*\]*

About 400,000 words across 500 files.

One thing that bugged me in the past was linking between notes, so I can chain ideas together (have tried in the past, but inspired recently by watching [How to take smart notes](https://vimeo.com/275530205)). Despite using vim for about 8 years, I've never really put much effort into writing my own vimscript. That's changed lately, which led to an epiphany...

    function! s:copy_filename_as_mdlink()
        let fname=expand(""%"")
        let @a=""["" . fname . ""](./"" . fname. "")""
    endfunction
    autocommand BufLeave * call s:copy_filename_as_mdlink()

Then, whenever I change buffer, I *automatically* copy the name of the file I was just in, letting me either `""ap` to paste the contents of the `a` register (where I've just created a markdown link), or more typically, `<c-r>a`, to paste the `a` buffer while in insert-mode.

I *may* even extend this process with something like:

    au BufNewFile *.md,*.txt execute 'normal ""ap'

To automatically insert the link to the file I just came from... (or maybe I'll wrap `:e` so that I can do this optionally...)

Hopefully some of you find this useful.

I think this has something to do with the fact that I don’t touch type. I type 70-80 WPM using my index and middle fingers, so I never bothered to learn how to type properly. However, the issue is that my fingers don’t just stay on the home row which makes it feel unnatural to use hjkl for navigation.

If anyone wants to help out with managing issues or pull requests, just leave a reply here, a private message on Reddit, or drop me an email at dev@w0rp.com, and we can discuss it. The repository lives inside of an open source GitHub Organisation I made a while ago (Dense Analysis) where I can pretty heavily control permission levels, so there's a lot of flexibility.

Long time Vi(m) user since the Irix times on SGI machines.A couple of weeks ago, I finally decided to spend some time digging a bit more into customizing Vim (thanks, random post on r/vimporn!) and I feel like I've discovered a new world.

I am sincerely impressed by the amount of functionality that can be achieved just by using the Vim scripting language.

With that, of course, comes a bit of frustration because there's a jungle of choices, options, and customizations.

At this point I think I've settled with a minimal set of plugins that gives me pretty much what I need, basically: Nerdtree, autopairs, and vim-lsp with asyncomplete.

The autocomplete so far is the most annoying bit, since I can't manage to find peace. Initially, I've tried jedi, but the lag was killing it for me, so when I discovered the combo vim-lsp/asyncomplete I was really happy... for a while.

I realized that with vim-lsp I couldn't show one of the most useful features that I found in jedi: realtime function signature preview, as I type. The pic show that I can see the signature of the functions for some modules (not for SWIG wrapped ones, for example?), this disappear after selecting the suggestion.

I heard there might be issues with the autopairs, but I've tried disabling it with no avail.

Does anyone has a suggestion (either an alternative to vim-lsp or a customization) for how  to fix this?

EDIT: this is what I have in mind:

I was using a conventional IDE in one of my courses, and realized that there is a feature that would be very useful to me. It's one of those error indicators where the error shows up at the right side of the screen, where the column represents the entire document(as opposed to syntax highlighting showing it at the exact line). So it shows you in the scope of the entire document the error, so you can jump to an approximate location. I realize that it works better with applications with scrollbars, but I still think it would be useful. If it doesn't exist, I figured I might as well take  a crack at writing a plugin for it. I just wanted to make sure it doesn't exist beforehand. Thanks!

* What is exactly an address, a range, and what are the differences
* Some text editor history (!) and how addresses came to be what they are today
* Some quirks of ranges, and a few shortcuts

full disclosure: I'm running vim in an Ubuntu vm under ESXi. The server is extremely beefy, OS is on an SSD with plenty of cores, plenty of ram, and not under any load whatsoever. But nevertheless I think this could be a vm issue, so my apologies if this isn't technically a vim question.

When I hit ctrl-P, it hangs under ""scanning included file"", for a good 5-10s. It stops on a particular file /usr/include/bits/stdint-uintn.h (which is only 1.1kb), for the longest, but it hangs on others to. Then ~10s later I can type again.

Has anyone dealt with this, and what are my options? I would be fine with excluding my /usr* from searching. I've ensured that all the VM settings are set to max performance, no throttling or IO quotas, so I dont know what else to try. It sucks because I'm really liking ESXi but this kind of gimped performance gives VMs a bad name. I've never seen this when running linux natively, worst is sometimes a 1-2 second pause.

I've not built any of my own ctags, (I'm using C++, forgot to specify that), so maybe thats the solution. but I'm curious about the cause of this too. Thanks",1581140168.0

I am currently an Emacs user (found Emacs about 1 month ago). I'm really getting annoying tho cause there are bugs that happen in Emacs and it really pisses me off!

I never tried Vim and I thought I'd give a shot! BUT! I have spend TONS of hours on configuring Emacs the last month (trust me, you have NO idea how many). And I don't want to do the same with Vim and then get disappointed in the end. So I'm gonna make some questions and thanks for anyone that will spend their time to answer me!

1. How does Emacs compare Vim. I've heard people saying that Emacs is more powerful than Vim? Is that true? And if yes, what Emacs can't do that Emacs can. I have to be clear tho. I'm not talking about thing like being able to open a terminal inside emacs, a browser etc. I'm only talking about text and programming related stuff!

2. A small list. How Vim does on this things? 

* Does Vim has a beautiful UI, including a bottom line, a beautiful theme (in the atom colors) etc.
* What about Live syntax error checking and highlight (SUPER IMPORTANT)?
* Auto complete (not so important but it would be cool)?
* Does Vim has Snippets like Emac's Yasnippet (ALSO VERY IMPORTANT)?
* Does Vim let's you remap EVERY single key? I don't like HJKL for example and i want to use IJKL
* How the window (spited screen) and buffer (opened files) system work on emacs?
* Are there packages that expend Vim's capabilities like on emacs or something similar?

3. Can Vim be a powerful, fully capable IDE for every language as Emacs? On of the reasons I've chosen Emacs when I was founding for an Editor about a month ago is that people said Vim is great for small editing and Emacs is great to used as a powerful programing Editor/IDE. After using Emacs I can confirm the Emacs part but I want people to tell me about the fully capabilities of VIM!

I'm making some software that needs to know the location of the cursor and the path to the file in the currently open buffer.

**What is the best way to frequently send small amounts of information to a running program?**
It should preferably not require synchronization/blocking on either end.

My quick-and-dirty solution is to write to a `cursor.pos` file on the `CursorMoved` autocmd that I can `scanf` from my program. This works, but noticeably slows down the editor when moving e.g. across multiple lines.

In Notepad++ plugins are DLLs (`.so` equivalent for Windows), so I can use the standard [interprocess communication tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ipc/interprocess-communications) available through the Windows API in C(++).

ryvnf,I have mixed feelings for Vim9 script. What do you think about it?,0.89,False,1580837262.0,69,ey91bd,vim,https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/ey91bd/i_have_mixed_feelings_for_vim9_script_what_do_you/,63,"## Introduction

I just found out that experimental support for Vim9 script [has been merged](https://github.com/vim/vim/pull/5530) to Vim's master branch.  Vim9 script is an entirely new version of the Vim programming language.  The differences are documented [in a help file](https://github.com/vim/vim/blob/master/runtime/doc/vim9.txt).  Among other things it features:

* A new function definition syntax using `:def` with new semantics
* New more efficient calling conventions for functions using the new declaration syntax
* New scoping rules and semantics for `let`
* Optional static typing
* `import`, `export`
* Classes

## My feelings for the changes

I personally dislike these changes.  Vim script is a language with a few quirks, which can take a while to learn to use efficiently.  Now there will be two different version of the language coexisting with different syntax and semantics.  I personally think the original Vim script worked quite well for its use case if one took the time to learn it, and it seems to me that the direction is to make it more into a general purpose programming language, which I think it shouldn't be.

I was initially excited when reading the announcement on what is being worked on for Vim9, which included improving Vim script as a language and improving its performance.  But this wasn't what I expected.

## My Expectation for optimizing Vimscript

I had more expected that they would optimize existing Vim script code.  Like making a function like the following:

    func Sum(list)
        let sum = 0
        for i in a:list
            let sum += i
        endfor
        return sum
    endfunc

Be optimized so that the argument won't be passed by dictionaries anymore, which I thought would be possible to do with a smarter compiler.

## Some reason why I don't the Vim9 script approach

The old Vim script from thousands of plug ins will never go away, so both languages has to coexist.  I think this will be quite bad and confusing for people who want to learn Vim script and have different versions which different semantics.  I also don't want to have to relearn everything to get the performance improvements by the new calling conventions.

As a developer who have released [one plugin](https://github.com/ryvnf/readline.vim).  I feel like it still makes more sense to code in the regular Vim script to preserve compatibility with older Vim versions.  For most plugins the performance improvement of Vim9 script probably isn't worth sacrificing compatibility for.  I probably think there are other plugin creators think the same.  This will probably also stand in the way for widespread adoption of Vim9 script.

## Summary

I liked Vim script for what it was, even with its quirks.  Vim9 script feels like an attempt to strap a general purpose language on to it.  This makes me feel a bit sad and disappointed.  I would have wanted improvements to Vim script which were backward compatible instead, not something that would require learning a new language.  There are already other general purpose languages like Go which is getting used more and more to create Vim plugins.

It also seems sad to me that the thousands of existing plugins will see no noticeable performance improvements, as the focus has been to make Vim9 script fast.

Sorry, if this is a bit ranty.  This change wasn't the way I expected.  Sense it has already been merged, it probably isn't going to change.  Still, I feel like I wanted to write my opinions and maybe hear your opinion.

I have recently been experimenting with different editing styles, and discovered that in some cases I find it easier to use `dw` and `.` to scoop out the inner text in a middle of a sentence (where counting exact number of words can be cumbersome).

My theoretical workflow would then be `dw`, `.` up to the last word I want to remove, and then `c.` to delete the last word and start typing immediately. Is there any way to do this with simple vimscript, or is there a more ergonomic vi-style way of doing this?",1580766662.0

I pushed through the initial learning curve by toying at home and later I decided to integrate what I learned into my workflow, by using vim extensions for my regular editors at work (vs code and intellij, mostly).

Ever since then, I've grown to like my setup, and I would like to move to the next level by trying to use pure vim. The issue is that even though I know how to edit a text file with vim quite well, I know nothing about moving beyond the concept of a single text file. I mean things like:

- how open files, move between them, search a specific one in a project, etc.
- how to move in an ide like manner (things like go to a function's definition, or check where a function is being called, in a project-wide level)
- how to keep several files visible at the same time, resize the panes, move between them, etc
- how to interact with a terminal
- how to use a debugger, if it's possible

I think you get the idea. I've tried to find information about it, but most of what I find is just either 101 basic tutorials for using  as a  text editor (the part I already know), or people sharing their very opinionated setups with a dozen plugins tailored to their liking. While I guess I'll end up having my own similar setup, I would like to start by learning the ""pure"" way of doing all of those things first.

CoolioDood,:drop <file> without changing the argument list?,0.66,False,1580687156.0,1,exxms1,vim,https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/exxms1/drop_file_without_changing_the_argument_list/,2,"I'm trying to figure out how to use `:drop` without changing the argument list. I already have a working solution, but I feel like it could be better.

In short, I'd like to use a command that either opens a file, or if the file is already opened, switches to the tab/window containing the file -- `:drop` seems to fit this. The issue I have is that `:drop` overwrites the argument list with whatever file it receives, and I'd like to preserve the args list.

I came up with a custom function, particularly for editing my vimrc, that essentially saves the args list, `:drop`s into the file, and then restores the args list:

    function! DropPreserveArgs()
      let s:args = argv()
      drop $MYVIMRC
    
      "" I can't just use :args here because 
      "" that would switch to the first file in the list
      argdelete *
      exe ""argadd "".join(map(s:args, {_, arg -> escape(arg, ' ')}))

      unlet s:args
    endfunction

I'm doing the string processing in `argadd` because `argv()` retrieves the args with unescaped spaces, and `:argadd` accepts space-separated paths.

It works, but what I'm doing is super inefficient and could take a while with a large list.  I feel like there *has* to be a better way, I just haven't found it. I tried to google for a solution but either I'm the first one with this problem (unlikely), or I can't find the right words to search. So I figured I'd ask here.

So first delete the first word and put a mark, go to the next word, visual select it and paste on top of it, then go back to the mark and paste there.

I'm pretty sure you can think a better way. If this  is the only one, maybe it is worth making a remap so I can do a bunch of them? because you can not repeat this kind of ""split"" action.

Now, I'm a bit out of my depths as far as how exactly an LSP server-client interaction works, but I was hoping to get it to work anyways. Unfortunately, no amount of googling helped me :/

I *suppose* my server needs to be active and it isn't, but how to _actually_ do it is beyond me. Here are the steps I took:

- install `python language server` (on arch, `community/python-language-server`)
- install relevant plugins (I use vim-plug):
```
Plug 'prabirshrestha/async.vim'
Plug 'prabirshrestha/vim-lsp'
```
and add the recommended lines to my `vimrc`:
```
if executable('pyls')
    au User lsp_setup call lsp#register_server({
        \ 'name': 'pyls',
        \ 'cmd': {server_info->['pyls']},

endif
augroup lsp_install
    au!
    autocmd User lsp_buffer_enabled call s:on_lsp_buffer_enabled()
augroup END
```
- add mapping for ale
```
nmap <silent> <F2> <Plug>(ale_rename)

    893.35
    5420.70
    2967.32
    671.40
    
After making a visual selection, I know that I can write them to a filter and use `awk` to calculate and display the sum:

    :'<,'>w ! awk '{ sum += $0 } END { print sum }'

I can overwrite the current selection with the sum:

    :'<,'>! awk '{ sum += $0 } END { print sum }'

I can copy it to my system clipboard (MacOS) and then paste it in with `""*p`:

    :'<,'>w ! awk '{ sum += $0 } END { print sum }' | pbcopy

But it seems like I must be missing the way to write that value into my document (or save it to a register or variable) without using the system clipboard (e.g. on a machine without a system clipboard available) and without overwriting the selected text. What am I missing? TIA!

EDIT: Interestingly, I figured this would have a more obvious solution, but from the responses so far it looks like the most straightforward solution is to duplicate the source data, then use a filter (which will replace the duplicate). In which case, in my mind it may actually be easier to just use the filter, yank the result into a register, undo to recover the source data, and paste the register.

EDIT2: Just found [another alternative](https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Capture_ex_command_output):

    :redir @a
    :'<,'>w ! awk '{ sum += $0 } END { print sum }'
    :redir END

Now register `a` will have the command output (plus a little cruft) and can be pasted wherever.

EDIT3: I think my favorite so far:
- yank selection (will end up in unnamed register `:help """"`, or choose a specific register)
- `:let foo = system(""awk '{ sum += $0 } END { print sum }'"", @"")`
- `:put =foo`",1580084945.0

For comparison, the vim way would be to yank a word into the clipboard register, then paste it somewhere (eg. search). This operation is \`""+yiw\` just to copy. Is it really quicker the vim way?

With something like vim it would be perfectly understandable that the learning is slow at the beginning, but if you subscribe to the vim way entirely, you will have speed gains in all areas. However, I still don't see how 5 keystrokes could possibly be preferable to \`cmd + c\`

The way I see it, vim's main draw is saving keystrokes and allowing you to edit in a way that is more declarative. I don't see either of these aims being fulfilled by doing things the vim way.

Here are some other non-vim methods I have been preferring:

* \`cmd + /\` to comment out lines, rather than \`gcc\`
* \`cmd + shift + f\` to search an entire directory
* \`option + up/down\` to move entire lines",1579940738.0

It is not clear for me how to achieve that. Maybe there are already existing commands doing something similar ?

After adding the after/ftplugin/vimwiki.vim file with the content

    autocmd BufEnter \*.md setlocal syntax=markdown

when I open a vimwiki note (or a diary entry or the wiki index) the syntax is still set to vimwiki. The output of the command :verb set syntax? is:

If I then refresh the file with :e or open a new window and come back to the vimwiki buffer then the autocommand is triggered and the syntax is set to markdown.

My impression is that the autocomand set with the ftplugin file is set but has no effect until you enter the buffer the next time.

Can anyone throw some light on this and help me fix the problem?

So now my buffer list is 1 - the file I'm working on and buffers 765 and 766 which contain some random low-level script output.

`filetype plugin indent on`

`...autocmd FileType vimwiki setlocal foldmethod=marker foldenable`

Thinking things would just be folded nicely as soon as I opened them.

**\[\[Edit: Solved -->** vimwiki was overwriting my foldmethod, apparently because it doesn't work nicely with foldmethod `marker.` You have add `let g:vimwiki_folding=expr` to vimrc, and then it has its own folding system, which works better anyway, and doesn't require littering your wiki files with additional {{{1 marks.  ignore the rest of this post **\]\]**

\---

When I open up one of my `.wiki` files and type `:set filetype` I get `filetype=vimwiki`, so I think that the filetype is correctly, but I'm still getting `foldmethod=manual`, and none of the folds are showing up unless I specifically enter `set foldmethod=marker`. It's kinda annoying to have to enter that every time though. Does this mean my autocmd is getting over-written somehow?

I tried removing the plugins that might be doing that and that didn't change anything. I even tried giving up on autocmd and just put `set foldmethod=marker` in my vimrc for all sessions, but somehow whenever I open a `.wiki` file, foldmethod has been reset to manual.

I love vim, the reality is that I love vim mode. I'm a mechanical keyboard fan (to the level that I compile my own firmware for them) and the more I use the keyboard, the happier that I am.

I like vim ideas so much that I even translated some of the vim idioms to my keyboard firmware. I have a leader key, I don't need to hold modifiers to perform most actions and I even have some macros.

Then, what is what I find about vim frustrating? The fact that I can only use it for certain kind of tasks.

I'm a also a programmer and I have some dozens of devices on my home network (NAS, raspberry pi, etc) .

The thing is that vim is probably the fatest editor I can use when it comes to edit configuration files. It feels so awesome to just type \`ciw\` to replace an entire word and move one line down and just repeat by pressing dot. I feel like a magician using vim and it is an awesome experience. 

However, I feel like a completely different person when I try to edit code using vim style: The problem I have to fix becomes a secondary problem and I spent most of the time thinking about which vim command should I type to the level that I am almost unable to write any useful code using vim.

I tried all kind of editors with vim emulation, spacemacs, vim with dozens of plugins.... but nothing seems to make vim suitable for coding ( in my personal situation of course).

It is very frustrating because I want to  use vim in as many aspects of my life as I could, but every time I try to use it on my actual daily job I fail, and It's been like this for years (almost a decade)

So what frustrates me about vim is that it is my favorite editor, but I can not use it as much as I could... Recently I invested money in Onivim 2 to see if it fulfills the promise of brin vim to the modern editor era...

I am using Vim to develop Python code, and so far I'm very happy with it. I often need to work remotely, and Vim is great for that because I just need to copy my .vimrc file and, ta-dah!, my whole environment is there.

There are some functionalities that I miss, however, and I'm wondering if there may be a plugin for those. In particular, does anyone know of a plugin that highlights Python modules that are imported but unused? Sometimes I end up with residual imports that are unnecessary and take a lot of memory and time.

Thanks a lot!",1579478759.0

Pressing `q` just quits. `Enter` jumps to a link and backspace goes back. So many plugin help files start with a contents page so I find myself doing `<leader>l` followed by (count)`n` to go to the link, hit `<CR>` read a bit hit `<BS>` then do (count)`n` again to go to then next link and so on.

The canonical way of doing these mappings would be to add it as a filetype in .vim/ftplugin but I like to keep everything in my .vimrc.

My biggest problems with it:

- Too many integrations for too many plugins I don't use
- Integrates through global variables with a fixed list of plugins (no interface to integrate a plugin that isn't on the list)
- Colored in its own way, so you need to use colorschemes that vim-airline-themes plays well with
- I don't really like Unix ricing culture, beyond the basics;  too many rices add dependencies that ruin a system's performance, portability and minimalism/usability (case in point, a thousands-line codebase for a fancy statusline is pretty ridiculous, IMO)

Really, I only need a couple of things on top of the stock statusline:

- Integration with Fugitive to show me which Git branch I'm on
- Integration with Obsession to show me whether or not I'm in a session
- Display filetype
- Don't include too much of anything I don't need

Therefore, I've taken on Tim Pope's [vim-flagship](https://github.com/tpope/vim-flagship), which I'm much happier with. I get to use autocmds instead of the oddly C-biased quasi-scanf interface that Bram decides to tack onto everything, and I get a few other global variables that I can mess with.

For anyone who uses Airline/Lightline, but is willing to rethink how much value the rice actually adds and might consider something with a smaller footprint, I highly recommend you take a look at the stock statusline. If that fails you for similar reasons that it's failed me (quasi-scanf interface, lack of transparency with global variables), consider Tim Pope's vim-flagship.",1579368758.0

I have been using Vim daily for a little more than a year now, and although I think I am ""fluent"" enough for most of my daily tasks, I have noticed that I have not been progressing much (as in learning new commands or new usages of commands I already know) over the last few months.

To solve that, I decided to read more of the details of the documentation and put them in practice.

I started with the `:substitute` command and wrote a little article on what I didn't know before but found useful over the past week or so (I am sure the rest has its uses too... I just did not find any!).

I talk about:

* The `g`/`c`/`n`/`&`/`r` flags
* Repeating substitutions, including the difference between repeating a *search* pattern and repeating a *substitute* pattern
* Using `\=` to do fancier replacements

While this is mostly aimed at fellow ""intermediate"" vimmers and might seem obvious to more experienced ones, any feedback would be greatly appreciated (especially since it's my first time writing about Vim)!

A *long* time ago I used the now deprecated **Vimperator** plugin in Firefox.
I couldn't imagine browsing without it until it disappeared because of Firefox's extension system dropping support for old scripts or whatever reasons.

I then tried some other alternatives but none were good enough compared to Vimperator.

It's been years now and I don't want to try every extension out there.

What do you guys use on a daily basis? Does it have huge pros and cons or does it simply work?

**Edit:**

Thanks to u/Nazeeh 's comment below, I was finally able to get it working.

First, I downloaded [universal-ctags](https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags-win32/releases) for Windows and added it to PATH.

Second, I installed the Vim plugin manager [Vim-Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) (for easily installing plugins).

Next, I installed the [Tagbar](https://github.com/majutsushi/tagbar) plugin.

When I first discovered tmux, it changed basically all my worklows (from programming to writing), for the better.

This tool can allow you to divide your terminal in multiple shells, control entirely your terminal with your keyboard (using the mouse is possible too), run scripts in the background and much more!

In this new article from my blog, I describe:

* Why should we use tmux?
* How to use tmux? How does it work?
* A basic configuration for you to understand how to configure tmux for your own needs.
* How to extend tmux possibilities with plugins

,Augment vim's built in `:split` and `:vsplit` command,0.67,False,False,1,eokys6,vim,https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/eokys6/augment_vims_built_in_split_and_vsplit_command/,2,"I recently wrote [a bit of vimscript](https://github.com/arumoy-shome/dotfiles/blob/master/vim/plugin/smart_split.vim) which exposes a command `:SPlit` that opens a given file in horizontal or vertical split based on the current window height and width. The command works fine, but I wonder now how I can integrate this bit of functionality into existing plugins that I use. For instance, I rely on [wincent/commant-T](https://github.com/wincent/command-t) and [tpope/vim-projectionist](https://github.com/tpope/vim-projectionist) for my navigational needs. Of course, I could ask the authors for help or maintain my own fork however I wonder if there is a simpler and less intrusive way? For instance, can I teach vim to simply use my `:SPlist` command whenever it needs to execute a `:split` or `:vsplit` command? To my understanding, the split commands can be issued in two ways:

1. via vim's commandline
2. internally from a vimscript using the `execute` command

Solution for 1. is simply a matter of introducing a commandline map, it's 2. that I am not sure about and need help with. Any guidance is much appreciated!

Many thanks for your help!

I want to use vim at my new job but there are some problems and I would like your suggestions on how to approach them.

First of all, allow me to explain my setup. There are some servers running our product. Those servers are not running linux but actually another version of unix with different architectures. Due do those problems, I can't compile/run the code/tests in my dev machine, I have to connect to one of the machines we have available to compile/run what we're building and do it over there. 

My first/current solution was to use a vim-sftp plugin and once I save my files on vim it uploads it to the server and I just alt+tab to my terminal emulator connected to it and do what I need. 

This solution has been working for a few months now but I'm running into some problems with YouCompleteMe and some other different auto-completion plugins that I tried. Since all the files/dependencies don't exist in linux (that's why I can't compile it locally), I downloaded the source files and told YCM to use them as dependencies. Unfortunately, some things don't work properly, like the GoToDefinition, etc. At least 50% of the time it doesn't work.

I did set up the remotely machine so I could develop on it. There, I could just use the compile\_commands.json that cmake did output for me. I tried ALE with that and it works flawlessly. The bad thing is that developing remotely is reaaally slow and I just can't keep doing that.

Sorry if this is too big, I just tried to explain as much as I could.

TL;DR/Long story short: The software I'm working with only compiles in some machines because they have dependencies unavailable on linux, so, I have to develop locally, push my files to the remote machine and build/run tests over there. I want to have a good auto complete like YCM/ALE while I'm coding locally.",1578965953.0

PaperCupsAhoy,Toggle a Set of Windows Together,0.67,False,False,1,ensnwe,vim,https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/ensnwe/toggle_a_set_of_windows_together/,0,"I have been using a version [ToggleTerm](https://github.com/blaueck/ToggleTerm) that I modified for a while now, and use it all the time to have a toggle-able `terminal` buffer for each project that I have open on a new tab. However, I've recently felt the need to open multiple `terminal` splits per project so I've been trying to come up with a different solution to support this.

&#x200B;

The approach has been to define a set of commands that can be used to open new horizontal/vertical `terminal` splits from already existing ones only. The functions that these commands call will then store information in a list about how each buffer was opened, the buffer number, etc. Then, the toggling process is as simple as determining if the set of terminal windows is open, going to each, and executing `hide`. Otherwise, if they aren't showing I can simply iterate through the list and open them in the same order, producing the same layout as before. The list might look like:

    [{'bufnr': 2, 'type': 'root'}, {'bufnr': 3, 'type': 'v'}, {'bufnr': 4, 'type': 'h'}]

This is all fine and dandy as long as the only `terminal` buffers that are closed are the ones at the end of the list. I have some special logic to deal with closing ones in the middle, but there are *way* too many edge cases in this simplistic method I've come up with.

&#x200B;

The point in this post is to look for advice on the best way to achieve what I want, or discover something better that already exists. I've looked into `winlayout()`, but I am having a hard time parsing through all the information it provides. I've tried a recursive approach, but again it feels like I'm just missing something.

Matlab has a ""peculiarity"" where if you want to instantiate the class ""foo"" which is located at `./+package1/+package2/@foo/foo.m` OR `./+package1/+package2/foo.m` you would say `myFoo = package1.package2.foo();` which is annoying because it's hard to complete outside of Matlab's built in editor.  I got some help early on in making a function to add to `gf` so I can open files structured like this, but tools like coc.nvim can't really help with completion unless you actually know the path structure before hand.

FZF is helpful for completion in general, so I thought why not use it for this.  Here's a slick mapping that will do the work of creating Matlabby ""paths"":

inoremap <expr> <c-x><c-m> fzf#vim#complete(

Been using vim for coding for years including cscope/ctags and plenty of home-brew customisations but code auto completion is something I've never got around to. So what recommendations for plugins do you have (and why) for me to become a code completion power user. Main languages that need support are C/C++,  Python and javascript. 

Something that can take account of a large set of compile switches (-D, #define blah I mean) - such as linux kernel config would absolutely nail it.

Neovim compatibility is a nice-to-have.

oh yes, and the moon on a stick ...

aleator,Beginner question on getting `:terminal` output.,1.0,False,False,8,emrffe,vim,https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/emrffe/beginner_question_on_getting_terminal_output/,7,"Hi,

I have an elementary vim scripting question. I'd like to write a Vim command that does the following:

1. Make a new split.
2. Launch a terminal program.
3. Wait for the program to stop and close the split.
4. Read the output produced in the second step into the original buffer.

This seems like a very common work flow, but I'm having trouble getting it to work. The problem is in steps 3 and 4. As a test I defined:

    function MyExitFunction(a,b,c)   
      close   
      read blah 
    endfunction 

Then did:

    :new | call termopen('fzf>blah',{on_exit:MyExitFunction} 

which does start the terminal and close the split after the program is done. The read  
 command, however, seems to do nothing. What should I do to get the  program output into the original buffer?

Note, fzf is not the actual program I'm running but just a random interactive shell command which works bit similarly to my custom program.",1578694324.0

The first command deletes every line without the string `foo.` The second command uses substitution on the remaining lines to remove anything that comes before and after the hyperlink. The problem is, running the command like this is SLOW. The first time doing anything in Vim was ever slow for me actually. The process uses more CPU than usual and the output spits out `828738 substitutions on 828738 lines`. Wait, what?

So what's going on here?

I ran the commands separately and they worked without any slowdown as you'd expect. I did some searching but haven't found an answer on why this happens. Though I did find an alternative. Pressing `Ctrl+v` then `Ctrl+j` results in the characters `^@` appearing in a blue color different from the default styling. This is called null character, I'm just learning this myself.

Is there any reason why I shouldn't use `^@` instead of the bar when entering multiple commands?

`d` is the delete operator.

Motion

* `w` \> excluding its first character.
* `e` \> Including the last character

pressing `e` at first goes to the end of the first word then jumps to the end of the next words.

pressing `b` will start jumping at the beginning of backward.

`d number motion`

You insert count before motion.

`2dd` deletes two lines.

`u` to undo last command, `U` to fix a whole line and `CTRL + r` for redo.

To put with `p` place cursor above or before.

`rx` replace the underline character with 'x'.

`ce` deletes character at cursor to the end of the word and puts in `insert mode`

`c` is delete and insert.

`CTRL + G` to show your location in the file and file status and information.

`gg` to the top of the file, `G` to the bottom of the file.

Type in line number than either press `G` or `gg`.

`/` for forward search, `?` for reverse search. `n` to find the next searched item forward. `N` goes backward.

`CTRL + o` puts where you had your cursor before, `CTRL + i` goes forward.

`%` to go the ending bracket if you are at the beginning bracket.

`:s/old/new/g` for replace operation within the **line**. Without `g` only changes first occurance. `:%s` replaces throughout the file. You can also do it with ranges of line `:beginning line number,ending line number`then `s`. adding `gc` asks for confirmation prior to replacing.

Running a shell command from vim `:!ls` so, `:!` then command.

Writing files with name `:w test`

Using visual selection to write blocks of code to a seperate file. First select with `v` then, `:` to see the lines selected, then `w test`.

Merging files `:r test` retrieve the file `test` and put in the cursor.

You can also input external command line output this way `:r !ls`.

`o` opens a line a below puts you on insert mode. `O` opens a line above.

For multicharacter replace use `R`. While in replace mode, as you write the underlying characters will be replaced.

For searching with ignore case `:set ic`. To enable highlighting of found words `:set hls is`

Prepand 'no' to switch an option off `:set noic`

`ctrl + w` to jump windows.

`:help user-manual`

Vimrc `:help vimrc-intro`

`CTRL + d` shows the suggestions, `tab` does autocomplete.

Edit:

## Thread suggestions

The suggestions came up in this thread.


`J` brings the bottom line at the end of the current line

`J` is for join with space.

`gJ` is for join without space.

`ciw` changes the inside of the current word

`vi)` Highlights everything inside a bracket. Works with `]` and `}` too.

Visual Inside Brackets > `vib`

Delete Inside Brackets > `dib`

Change Inside Brackets > `cib`

Go(?) Uppercase Inside Brackets > `gUib`

`CTRL + o` and `CTRL + i` are jumps.

`dt<somthing>` delete till <something> and `df<something>` delete find <something>

`cw` change word

`ci""` change inside parenthesis

I wanted my buffers to behave exactly like tabs in Chrome or Firefox when they are closed and I also wanted to prevent the destruction of windows on buffer deletion so I came up with this mapping:

    "" Close buffer (without closing window)
    nnoremap <expr><leader>w len(getbufinfo("""")[0].windows) > 1 ?
        \ "":close<CR>"" :
        \ (bufnr("""") == getbufinfo({""buflisted"": 1})[-1].bufnr ? "":bp"" : "":bn"").""<bar>bd #<CR>""

It first checks if the buffer we want to close is present in more than one window. If so, only the window is closed (just a personal preference, you can remove that check if it's not the behavior you expect). Otherwise it checks if the current buffer is the last one (ie has the highest buffer number). Based on the result, we switch either to the next or the previous buffer exactly like tabs in Chrome/Firefox. Then the buffer we just left is closed. This is done in this order to prevent the closing of any window.

I also display my open buffers using vim-airline's option:

    let g:airline#extensions#tabline#enabled = 1

Now vim has one weakness: It is super configurable. Yeah, I know people love that feature but honestly I just can't be arsed to spent hours upon tweaking the config. It is especially bad, as I use a extreme variety of programming languages and having to research the best plugins for every one would leave me with no time for actually writing code.

Just taking taking someones elses config does not really work that well either because they have build it mostly for their special use cases.

It has built-in functionality for 1) changing windows, 2) resizing windows and 3) swapping buffers, and is extensible so that more functionality can be added by users.

The plugin uses popup and floating windows from `vim>=8.2` and `nvim>=0.4.0`. Limited functionality is available with `vim>=8.1.1140`, but the interface is deficient without popup windows.

This file itself is located in a .zip bundle. So to access the .csv I issue vim [file.csv.zip](https://file.csv.zip) and then open the .csv file in question by pointing the cursor at the file name and hitting Enter.

Inside vim, I usually search for a certain line by typing `/` and entering a certain value.

Given the above sample of a .csv file line, let's say there are hundreds of lines containing the same value `34935335` but having different values in all other fields.

How could I effectively search for a line that contains values `34935335`, `33.850000` and `60.750000` ?

I've also tried searching for existing outlines, but either none exist or my Google-fu is weak.

There are a lot of vi binding and vim emulators out there. I've made a hash of one, contributed to another, and now I'm writing a third. Ideally, I'd like to use a similar algorithm so that it's as easy as possible to match vim's behavior.

Presumably other vim emulators would benefit from this being easily accessible as well.

Lots of you will know about LSP (Language Server Protocol), of which there are many Vim clients of various quality (obviously, YCM is the best! :D), but there's also DAP (Debug Adapter Protocol) which is to debuggers what LSP is to completion engines.

Vimspector implements the DAP client and a debugging front-end for Vim. It supports a number of languages out of the box and in theory _any language that VSCode supports_ debugging.

VSCode and Sublime Text have very very nice support for subtle visual selection colors out of the box.

Setting `hi Visual ctermfg=237` gets me pretty close. It changes the background color of the selection but then all of the foreground (the code)'s colors change to a mono-color grey.

However, after a few days of using it, I noticed that in vimtex you can open a fold by going there with your cursor and pressing either the l or h key (movement keys). This is pretty convenient as it is a lot quicker than pressing zo with less movement of the fingers. But the same does not work on simpylfold. Looking through both help files it does not seem to be mentioned in either file.

My question is now, how can I emulate the behaviour of vimtex for simpylfold (or any file with foldings in general). I guess you could map l to a function which checks the foldlevel of the current line and then opens the fold (or not), but that seems a bit laborious. Does someone know a better way?",1578122550.0

7sidedmarble,Dead simple fuzzy searching with /,0.89,False,1578075551.0,14,ejiy8s,vim,https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/ejiy8s/dead_simple_fuzzy_searching_with/,5,"I was trying to slim out some of the massive list of plugins I use and found a pretty neat alternative to using something like the `:BLines` command in FZF that I often use:

```
cnoremap <expr> <space> '/?' =~ getcmdtype() ? "".*"" : ""<space>""
```

This makes it so everytime you press `<space>`, but only in the `/` or `?` searching command lines, you insert a `.*` instead. So now typing `/def foo` can find `def foo` or `def bar(foo)`.

Another kind of interesting one is:

```
cnoremap <expr> <space> '/?' =~ getcmdtype() ? "".*\\_s*.*"" : ""<space>""
```

This matches any character, followed by one newline, followed by any character (roughly something like that, I'm not a regex expert). You can use this for some crazy visual selections across lines without much thinking about the regex involved. If for some reason you had like:





    def bar
      foo
    end





You can then type `/def<space><space>end` to match the whole thing. Obviously this is a contrived example but I thought it was interesting.

If you want to retain normal usage of `/` but have this option available, you could also make it happen only on `?`:

```
cnoremap <expr> <space> getcmdtype() == ""?"" ? "".*"" : ""<space>""
```

Then to fuzzy search you'd just have to hit `?` remember to swap your `n`s and `N`s. I personally never press `?` and just use `n` and `N` respectively inside of an `/` search anyways.

This might seem like sacrilege to the regex aficionados but I was exposed to the fuzzy searching of sublime before I ever got into vim, so this simple little change is like a life changer for me.

Note credit for some of the vimscript here goes to romainl, as always his vim fu is insane and I found this specific kind of way to cmap only for ? and / and then used it for the purposes of fuzzy searching.",1578102818.0

Function is shown below is unused despite its counterpart ""s:NetrwSaveWordPost()"" being used, it basically remembers the directory/file that was under your cursor:

fun! s:NetrwRestoreWordPosn()

sil! call search(s:netrw\_saveword,'w')

endfun

I don't know why this is not used instead of using the cursor position returned by 's:SetRexDir', which makes using tree-listing, sorting, etc unusable. The only down side I can see in using this, is the conundrum of having two files with identical filenames in the same directory in tree-listing. However, I think this is resolved by the incorporation of '|' in demeaning directory depth to the user. In conclusion, why is it unused?

anyone else experiencing this? anything else is needed to make this work?

For example

    import math
    print(f'Pi is equal to {math.pi}')

By selecting the two lines of code by `Vj` and typing `:!python <CR>`, the selected lines would get executed and replaced by (the line that's not selected is unaffected by this) :

I have spent a lot of effort to tackle the performance issue of vim-clap. And now I'm very happy to share some good news! With the latest version of vim-clap, the performance issue and the flicker of running async job(I wrongly thought this flicker is hard to fix before) have been completely resoloved! All the heavy job has been handled by the external binary written in Rust. And vim-clap now can deal with even 1 million items decently.
