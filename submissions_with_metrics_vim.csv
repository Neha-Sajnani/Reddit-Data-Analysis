mugnozzo,Why I switched from Emacs to Vi(m),0.83,False,False,11,frsghk,vim,https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/frsghk/why_i_switched_from_emacs_to_vim/,24,"First of all: I've never taken part in the Vi(m) VS Emacs war, and I'm not going to do it.

I started using Emacs about ten years ago. I was a Linux user and I was looking for something powerful and simple, and the first editor I found was Emacs. If I would have heard about Vi(m), I'd have choosen it.

I loved Emacs and I delved every day deeper into it, mastering it in many ways.

Some months ago I needed to do stuff on a server that was not mine and the owner didn't want that I installed anything on it. So I had to choose between Nano and Vim and I obviously choosed Vim .

I started using it beside Emacs and last week, after some months I decided to totally switch to it (actually in these days I'm trying Neovim). 

Why did I switch?

1) I'm a firm believer in KISS, I use ArchLinux, and some Suckless stuff as Dwm. And I must say Vi(m) is KISSer as Emacs.

2) I often work on VPSs and remote Linux servers and I don't want to install Emacs on every server I work on.

3) Sometime I have to work on very big files, on which I see that Vi(m) is very faster.

4) Vi(m) shortcuts are faster and you don't destroy your little finger hitting CTRL one billion of times per minute.

That's it. I just wanted to share this. I don't hate Emacs and (as said before) I don't take part in the Vi(m) VS Emacs war but, for what I need and what I have to do, Vi(m) is just soooo better.",1585609631.0

`noremap` is used after you enter `VISUAL` mode, and `onoremap` is used for operator-pending mode(Actually it will invoke the operation defined in `xnoremap`\`before). In this way, you could create more useful text objects.

I created a vim plugin for opening with vim as well as navigating in the contents of debian packages.

It works pretty much the same as opening zipfiles / tarballs with vim, simply point vim to the debian package and it will open its list of files in vim for you to explore.

Navigating in the debian package is handed over to `netrw`. In there you can also modify existing files of the package, add additional files or edit the CONTROL information of the package. On exit, if the plugin detects that there were changes, it repackages the debian package again and by default puts it under `<orig-deb-package-name.deb>.new`.

Here's a link to the plugin: [https://github.com/bergercookie/vim-deb-preview](https://github.com/bergercookie/vim-deb-preview).

Feel free to share your thoughts on whether this may be useful / ways to improve it or really any other sort of feedback that comes to your mind. :)

If you write the following inside of an HTML file:  


<div class=""""></div>  


...put your cursor inside of the double quotes """", and hit Ctrl+Space,

you get a list of all classes that can be found in every css file in your workspace. So even if the file is inside a folder structure, as long as its in the workspace every single class will be listed.  


Having that autocompletion is really great. We also use Bootstrap, so if you type something in like  
""mxs0"" you get the proper ""mx-sm-0"" as a suggestion. Really, really handy.  


I would like to ask you, how one should approach to recreate this awesome autocompletion inside of vim/nvim  


I'm not really good at configuring vim, but i tried coc.vim. Sadly i could not get it to autocomplete CSS classes inside of HTML templates.  


Do you guys have any suggestions or guides that i could check out.

My main issue now is figuring out the ecosystem a little bit. I'm having some trouble deciding how best to start using Vim as a main editor.

These are the options:

\- gVim in Windows (I'm finding it annoying with some of the batch files not working properly and not being able to make the window color dark, like the title bar etc.). Also, one of the biggest advantages I've heard is the terminal + vim combination, which is annoying to set up with cmd/powershell (if anyone has good recommendations, please do tell. I've heard Cmder is useful, but I've not tried it)

\- Using WSL also seems very popular, but I'm not sure exactly how this works. Just using multiple WSL terminal windows? I don't really understand this set up, but I've not used WSL much so maybe thats why.

\- The last option is to use an Ubuntu VM and launch Vim in that. That way I have access to all the native Linux tools and there's no need for hacking around. And I can just mount my windows drives and have access to any data I need. I'm comfortable with VMs as all my development used to be done on a VM, with Windows as my main for Windows only software and games. I use Windows now as my main dev environment though, so I'd like Vim to be set up and usable straight away in case I ever need it.

If you use Vimium daily, you know how much it can affect your speed and productivity and I always wanted to make/use something that is more system-wide.

The creator published about his new app a few months ago on Reddit ([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/dc95by/vimac_vimium_for_macos/)) and everyone was discussing monetization and no one cared to share it enough.

If a tool is going to affect your daily interaction with the system you use daily, it should be more popular.

I can ramble forever, but you need to know that I'm typically aware of the new apps and tools to a certain extent and the fact that this didn't show up on my radar earlier says something.

When I was a windows user, I tried to only open one instance of Vim to avoid the ""Hey someone already has this swap file!"" problem.  Now I run a tiling window manager on linux with good clipboard support and I find I have (generally) 2-3 vim sessions open.

I can use vim --servername vim --remote-silent foo.c or whatever to guarantee that every file opens in the SAME instance of Vim... but it's not quite what I want.

# Question
Without using a shared tmux session or pinning my opened Vim instance to every ""tag""/""screen"" of my tiling window manager, is there a way to synchronize open buffers across multiple instances in classic Vim?

It seems to me that client-server Vim should be able to do this, but all the searching I've done points to ""you want to use splits"" or ""use the remote flag to launch in the same window"" but that's not quite right.

What I actually want is separately open vim instances that contain all the buffers in all the instances.

That way if I'm on screen 1 writing some code and I open my .vimrc with my current code project, if I flip to screen 2 and try to open .vimrc, it doesn't say ""Hey the swap file is busy you dummy"" it just gives me access to the same buffers again but through a different viewport.

Is this stupid?  Should I just disable swap files and save like crazy?

It seems like [the remote functions of vim server](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/remote.html) should handle this, but it doesn't.  It's all separate or all in one, but not all in one across multiple instances.

dlukes,Make hard-wrapping play nice with Markdown link concealing,1.0,False,1585320094.0,3,fpwcrh,vim,https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/fpwcrh/make_hardwrapping_play_nice_with_markdown_link/,5,"Plasticboy's [vim-markdown](https://github.com/plasticboy/vim-markdown) plugin allows Markdown links to be concealed, but unfortunately, this results in a very ragged right margin when combined with hard-wrapping. Take for instance the following example text, wrapped at 72 characters:

    Here's a [link that will hard wrap to the next
    line](https://example.com/foo/bar/baz). And let's carry on a bit, just
    enough to do one more line.

The `line](https://example.com/foo/bar/baz)` part is one long ""word"" and long words are generally a pain with hard-wrapping, which is one of the reasons one would like to conceal the URL and ignore it for wrapping purposes.

However, even when concealing is enabled, hard-wrapping the paragraph (either with `gw` or `gq`) takes into account all the characters that are there, even those that are hidden, so the result is not much of an improvement:

    Here's a link that will hard wrap to the next
    line. And let's carry on a bit, just
    enough to do one more line.

Ideally, I would like hard-wrapping + concealing to result in something like this displayed in my Vim buffer:

    Here's a link that will hard wrap to the next line. And let's carry on a
    bit, just enough to do one more line.

Which would actually correspond to this content in the file:

    Here's a [link that will hard wrap to the next line](https://example.com/foo/bar/baz). And let's carry on a
    bit, just enough to do one more line.

Is there a hard-wrap/conceal option that I can set to get this behavior? Or maybe a `formatexpr` function that achieves this? AFAIK, the only environment that does this is Emacs org-mode and it's really pretty slick :)",1585342117.0

ArmedHoax,Creating a custom operator that takes a count and is repeatable with dot,0.91,False,1585393862.0,8,fpcd6a,vim,https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/fpcd6a/creating_a_custom_operator_that_takes_a_count_and/,10,"Hi all!

New redditor and rather new Vim enthusiast here. In the last weeks, I've started digging into Vimscript after I realized that some features I wanted are not covered by existing plugins. I worked through 'Learn Vimscript the hard way' and already managed to get some cool things working, but I keep banging my head against this issue and can't solve it on my own. I think that plugins such as surround and sandwich have solved this issue, but I've looked into their code and didn't get it :(

I want to create a custom operator that takes a \[count\] and a {motion}. The operator works on the text selected by the {motion}, and the operation depends on the value of \[count\]. Therefore, the \[count\] and the {motion} must not be conflated! After some try and error and reading a lot of stackoverflow I've come up with the following solution, reduced to a minimal working example:

    nnoremap <Plug>op :<C-u>call Setup()<CR>g@ 
    nmap M <Plug>op
    function! Setup()
        let s:count = v:count1
        set operatorfunc=MyOperator
    endfunction
    
    function! MyOperator(type)
        if a:type ==# ""char"" || a:type ==# ""line""
            normal! `[v`]""ay
            echom ""Count="" . s:count . "", Yanked selection: "" . getreg('a')
        elseif a:type ==# ""v"" || a:type ==# ""V"" || a:type ==# ""\<C-v>""
            normal! gv""ay
            echom ""Count="" . s:count . "", Visual selection: "" . getreg('a')
        endif
    endfunction

The `echom` commands make it easy to see that this works as intended. The problem occurs when I try to repeat this! Without a count, `.` does the right thing. But for `[count].`, Vim only repeats the `g@` and uses the count to modify the last motion instead. As a result, both the `{motion}` and the `[count]` are wrong.

Since Vim does not offer the plugin developer the option to change what `.` does, it seems to me that the only hope is vim-repeat. So I added the following line at the end of `MyOperator`:

    call repeat#set(""<Plug>op"") 

Now the count is correct, but for each invocation of `.` I need to enter the motion again (unsurprisingly). Therefore, to make this work I somehow need to save the motion. But by using Vim's `g@` mechanism, I only obtain the `'[ ']` marks, which is not sufficient! I could use `input()` to save the motion explicitly and then play it back via

    execute ""normal! v"" . input . '""ay' 

but that would require the user to hit enter after the motion, which would not feel very operator-y. Alternatively, I could try to use `getchar()` but then I wouldn't know when the motion/textobject is complete!

Right now, this seems like a glaring hole in Vim's plugin API to me. Am I missing something obvious?

**Edit:**\
Maybe I was not clear enough about the desired behaviour!\
`5M2l` should select 2 characters and pass count 5 to the operator.\
Afterwards `7.` should select the same 2 characters and pass count 7 to the operator.

**Edit 2:**\
I found a solution. The following works, and with some tinkering I extended it to visual mode, too. The core idea is to use vim-repeat, throw away the count (i.e. save it separately) and use `normal! .`

    nnoremap <Plug>op :<C-u>call SetupOperator()<cr>g@
    nmap M <Plug>op

    xnoremap <Plug>opVisual :<C-u>call SetupOperator()<Bar>call MyOperator(visualmode())<CR>
    xmap M <Plug>opVisual

    nnoremap <Plug>opRepeat :<C-u>call MyOperatorRepeat()<cr>
    nnoremap <Plug>opRepeatVisual :<C-u>call MyOperatorVisualRepeat()<cr>

    function! MyOperatorRepeat()
        call SaveCountBeforeRepeat()
        normal! .
    endfunction

    function! MyOperatorVisualRepeat()
        call SaveCountBeforeRepeat()
        execute ""normal! 1v\<Esc>""
        call MyOperator(visualmode())
    endfunction

    let g:on_repeat_reuse_last_count = 1
    function! SaveCountBeforeRepeat()
        if g:on_repeat_reuse_last_count
            let s:count = v:count > 0 ? v:count : s:count
        else
            let s:count = v:count1
        endif
    endfunction

    function! SetupOperator()
        let s:count = v:count1
        set operatorfunc=MyOperator
    endfunction

    function! SetupVisual()
        let s:count = v:count1
    endfunction

    function! MyOperator(type, ...)
        if a:type ==# ""char"" || a:type ==# ""line""

I am not good in navigating using `ctrl-d` / `ctr-u` or the `Page Up` /`Page Down` keys. I tried, but I always go back to scrolling with my mouse (I know...) or holding `j` and `k`.

So, the other day I came up with this mapping:

`"" Hitting space makes j and k move faster`

`nmap <Space>j 10j<Space>`

`nmap <Space>k 10k<Space>`

`nmap <Space><Space> <Nop>`

Basically, when `Space` is pressed (in normal mode), a sort of ""fast navigation"" mode is triggered, where `j` and `k` move 10 lines instead of just one. Another press of `Space` exits the mode.

Yesterday I searched a little about it and [this StackOverflow question](https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/365/is-it-possible-to-use-two-different-color-backgrounds-in-a-single-vim-buffer) helped me.

The answer provided by the user Rich uses the signs features (mostly used by plugins for linting) to highlight the whole line where a sign is placed.

So I did a function that clears all signs and then starts placing signs. It first places a sign when it finds a line like ""\`\`\`sh"" and continues to place it until it finds ""\`\`\`"". I also disable the signcolumn because I only want the different background highlight.

My second colour in vim is yellow (I'm sure there's a technical term, but I mean the default colour for things like my status bar or mode indicators). This is different from the colour which highlights `NOTE:`s and `WARNING:`s in the help documentation.

When I'm moving around, with `j` and `k` occasionally one will 'hang' as a black character on a yellow background (just for that character space) on the space I moved *from*. This covers up anything that was there before, but only virtually. If I go back to that space and do it again I can achieve the same affect (sometimes) with the other character (so a highlighted virtual `j` becomes a highlighted virtual `k`). If I move away from it with `h` or `l` then the virtual character vanishes, revealing the original character (even if it's just whitespace).

I can occasionally reproduce this with `h` and `l`, but less often (because I use them less I think).

This doesn't tend to happen when I double (or treble, or more)-tap. I think that the problem has something to do with an ambiguous mapping, but what? And why only in tex documents?

If I quit a reopen the file (even if I save the changes) the phantom characters are no longer there.

If I open NERDTree the phantom characters reamin in the same place on the screen, regardless of which window they are now in 9so they print over the NERDTree window).

I have recently installed vimtex and ultisnips. I've played around with the vimtex settings but haven't used ultisnips at all. As far as I'm aware, I haven't mapped either `j` or `k` to anything since downloading them.

What is going on?!?! How can I stop it? It's really distracting!!!

OK, so now we know that it is the statusline plugin, not the colorscheme, or at least not something that the colorscheme *defines*. So for fixing the green block:

Egst,Disable aligning indentation under open parentheses,1.0,False,1584988185.0,8,fnnsid,vim,https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/fnnsid/disable_aligning_indentation_under_open/,4,"For some reason vim does this kind of indentation in parentheses:

    foobarbaz(|)
    
    foobarbaz(
              |
    )

It aligns the cursor just to the right of the opening parentheses.

The only plugin, that I use, that messes with indentation is jiangmiao/auto-pairs. I tried removing it, but nothing changes.

All plugins used:

* sheerun/vim-polyglot
* vim-airline/vim-airline
* patstockwell/vim-monokai-tasty
* scrooloose/nerdtree
* ryanoasis/vim-devicons
* jiangmiao/auto-pairs
* moll/vim-bbye

As far as I know, none of these should cause this.

My relevant .vimrc settings:

    syntax on
    set encoding=utf-8
    set number
    set nowrap
    set cul
    set is
    set hls
    set tabstop=4
    set shiftwidth=4
    set expandtab
    set nosmartindent
    set noautoindent
    set nocindent

I tried to disable smartindent, autoindent and cindent, but still no luck.

As u/tarje mentioned, this behavior is different for each file type. For example:

    [.c]
    foobarbaz(
              |
             )
    
    [.js]
    foobarbaz(
        |
    )

    [.r]
    foobarbaz(
              |
    )

    [no extension]
    foobarbaz(
    |
             )

Does anyone know what could be responsible for this behavior? I would prefer the indentation, that happens with .js files shown above.",1585012881.0
bozymandias,vimdiff: what are the best styles and remappings?,1.0,False,False,39,fnmof6,vim,https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/fnmof6/vimdiff_what_are_the_best_styles_and_remappings/,7,"Hi all. I've just discovered the benefits of setting vimdiff as my `merge.tool` in my .gitconfig file. 

Love it. but I thought I might ask more experienced users two questions.

First, the diff3 merge.conflictstyle seems to be the most common arrangement (i.e. so the top row is \[Local, Base, Remote\], and the bottom is \[Merged\]), but do you actually use the \[Base\] version? Kinda seems like it's just wasting space there. I can't imagine it's very common to want to take the ancestral version in any real merge.

Secondly, what do you do for remappings? I find it a bit tedious to type out `:diffget RE` and `:diffget LO` all the time, so if I set the remapping with `nnoremap <leader>dgr :diffget RE<cr>` from within the session, that speeds things up. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to work when I have the same thing saved in my .vimrc. The bindings just do nothing; is this being overwritten somehow (maybe that's a git thing?) Any other suggestions as to how to shorten the ""get"" actions (and what your favourite/most conventional remappings are) would be very welcome.

Thanks for your input.",1585009128.0

1. If it uses the unix definition of line (a.k.a. ""having an EOL at the end of the file"").
2. How EOL is encoded (CRLF vs. LF).

I disabled ""fixendofline"" for the former and it does the latter by default, so that is fine.

But there is a problem. Vim cannot autodetect all that under some scenarios. Particularly, it cannot work when creating a new buffer from scratch, which is giving me some trouble.

Can I change the default/fallback behavior of 1 and 2? How?

Thank you.

Update: TL;DR, combining 'nofixendofline' with setting up 'fileformats' (with a final s) as explained by u/Allan-H and u/stalefishies does the trick.

In case anyone wonders, it seems that 'nofixendofline' keeps adding the newline when an empty file stops being empty when the value of 'ff' is unix - which is perfect.

Finally, it doesn't remove it when the file is """"""emptied"""""". However, this is nice. Vim (unlike other unixlike editors like Gedit) allows you to remove the last line manually instead of taking that responsibility. An extra `dd` will completely empty the file.",1584997316.0

I have a few scripts in my `.vim/ftplugin/mail/`. One of them includes:

    "" add all the contact information in my abook
    set dictionary +=~/.contacts/personal
    set dictionary +=~/.contacts/uni
    set dictionary +=~/.contacts/charity

I use abook for contacts management, keeping all of my contacts in relevantly-names directories in \~`/.contacts` Charity is a charity I volunteer for. This snippet (conditional on the file being mail) adds to my dictionary all the different directories, so that I can have completion for names, email addresses etc. Mostly this is useful for typing names quickly and putting people in touch with other (sending them each other's information), which I have to do a lot in my role for the charity. 

This works but i would like to improve on the following:

It isn't very elegant and doesn't follow the 'vim way'. If I added a new contacts list (say `~/.contacts/extended_family`) I would have to remember to add it manually to this list in the file. I have tried `set dictionary +=~/.contacts/*` but that returns an error. I'm sure there's a good way to do this so I never need to worry about this sort of thing. What is it?

Is there a way of setting some kind of variable (probably in `~/.vim/vimrc`) of all my different contact information, then just calling that variable here and adding it the list? I know that still includes the problem of manually adding each new directory, but:

*  I edit my .vimrc more often and would probably think to add them more easily.
* The variable could perhaps be defined in a more general way (something like \~/.contacts/\* than things can be added like I have at the moment, thus solving the problem?

PaperCupsAhoy,Conditionally Map Value of Variable To Call Function Or Act As Normal,0.67,False,False,1,fm66pf,vim,https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/fm66pf/conditionally_map_value_of_variable_to_call/,3,"I have a bit of code that I use to scroll the cursor that relies on timers and works such that hitting `<C-D>` will ""flick"" the cursor down half a page or so depending on the configured velocity. This functionality is very similar to [comfortable-motion.vim](https://github.com/yuttie/comfortable-motion.vim).

Let's say that my cursor is in the middle of the page, and I want to scroll down to code that is 10 lines below the current cursor position. If I have the scrolling set up with a high enough velocity, the cursor will instead move 20 lines downwards, i.e. not where I want it to go. I understand I can just do `10j`, but hear me out.

I want to be able do do something like:

    let g:scroll_stop_key = ""<Esc>""
    exe 'nnoremap <silent> ' . g:scroll_stop_key . ' g:is_scrolling ? call stop_scrolling() : ' . g:scroll_stop_key

with the intention that if I am *currently* scrolling, the key will stop the scrolling. If I am not scrolling, the key functions as normal.

The above method of doing this does not seem to work, and I feel that it will have problems if the user has defined other mappings for the key they are passing as the ""stop key"".

1. Why does the above method not work?
2. Is there a better way to do this? If so, what is it?
3. How can I handle mapping for different modes? If I am scrolling in visual mode the above example will not work. Is there a generic 'map to all modes'?",1584779899.0

I would like to add eslint and prettier to my setup but I am worried about just loading a ton of things into my setup in general. It probably wouldn't impact performance that much but I am wondering is it worth it or it's better to have some sort CI solution for enforcing style rules when I push to my repo for example.

Imagine:   
\- Simple inline image previews for Markdown image tags.  
\- Brief previews for netrw (NERDTREE).

My personal motivation came about when I was designing a vim plugin that would browse a message board, and it would be nice to be able to preview image messages instead of having to cumbersomely launch an external viewer.

Are there more convenient solutions for this problem? Like maybe having all users in a group, a .vim directory outside /home and just symlinking it?",1584508689.0

function MyFunc() {

requires

return, return, Ctrl+o, k, tab 

to get where I can begin typing. I just discovered ctrl+o for that 1 time motion exit which is incredible, but I wonder if we can do better.  

I often use a snip expansion to give me an expansion (named or unnamed) that I can tab through to get straight to more typing, but if I need to add a return function or something inside, its back to the example above, so I was just curious if anyone else has tinkered to save 4 keystrokes.

This plugin uses `v:oldfiles` as a starting point, and maintain the later changes by itself.

It also provide three ways to access the MRU files list.

1. quickfix through `:MRUFiles`
2. fzf.vim through `:FzfMruFiles`
3. vim-clap through `:Clap mrufiles`

It also allowed Vim/Neovim use the same or different MRU files list.

I don't want to run the code with the built-in VIM python module, since that has a few limitations, namely using different python versions without restarting and using virtual enviroments. What I am looking for instead is a way to open a new buffer where the program gets executed (similar to PyCharms way of running code).

After setting up the LSP for python it works mostly perfectly, there are some things I cant jump to definition for and I have to default to ctags but that is probobly due to an error in my setup somewhere.  


It seems that the LSP jumps to the source perfectly, and on top of that provides autocompletion benefit and others I am probobly still unaware of. Some might argue that it is bloat but with neovim currently having LSP support bultin and im sure vim is soon to follow, this seems to be a non-issue very soon.

is it possible to have vim automatically color code predefined strings in particular colors? For example

Similar to syntax highlighting, but for predefined strings...

I would like this to happen constantly (for particular file types only) without having to use a keybinding to trigger the action.

My first thought was to create a syntax highlighting file myself. But then I won't be able to use the actual syntax highlighting any longer, correct?

Let's say I am writing a bash script. I'd still like the regular bash highlighting to be used for this file, but additionally highlight those few strings defined above. If this possible?

**Problem**: I use Vim to view log files as they are written. In order to reload the file and see if more output has been written, I use `:e`. However, more than once I have pressed `:w` by mistake, and by writing to the log file while other program was outputting I have messed up the log file.

**Pseudo-solution that I found**: to open them in read-only (`nowrite`) mode by calling Vim with  `view` instead of `vim`, or to open them with with read-only (`nowrite`) and no-modify (`nomodifiable`) modes with `vim -M <filename>`. But it is annoying to have to remember to use these other commands instead of the usual `vim` that I'm so used to.

**Solution that I would like**: to write something in my `.vimrc` that makes Vim start automatically in `nowrite` and `nomodifiable` modes if the filename ends with `.log`. Then, if I really needed to write to a log file (which very rarely occurs, if ever), I could always set `:set write` and `:set modifiable`.

What's going on??,0.75,False,False,2,fhx5xd,vim,https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/fhx5xd/e471_when_i_use_vim_c_emailvimconfig_as_my_editor/,1,"I use neomutt, with the editor set as vim.

I use neomutt, with the editor set as vim. Until now I had been working perfectly. I decided I wanted to modify vim's behavior when opened in neomutt (things like sourcing email-specifi abbreviations like my email address, and starting in insert mode). Since the editor in neomutt is just set as a command, I put in my neomuttrc `set editor = 'vim -c source ~/.config/neomutt/config/vim/vimConfig` (the deep dir structure is useful for organisation. I have lots of config files). 

vinCofig looks like this:

    source ~/.config/neomutt/config/vim/abbreviations
    NERDTreeClose
    norm O
    norm O
    startinsert

The abbreviations file is a list of abbreviations which are only really useful for emails (specific signatures etc.). NERDTreeClose is there because vim starts with NERDTree open if the buffer is empty, but I don't want that if I'm writing a fresh email (which would have an empty buffer). The two `norm O`'s are because the vast majority of email I write is in response to other emails. this puts two lines of blank space between the quoted text and my cursor. Start in insert mode because in an email normally I just want to start writing. 

&#x200B;

When I write an an email in neomutt, vim lanuches and prints this message:

    ""~/.config/neomutt/config/vim/vimConfig"" 5L, 90C
    Error detected while processing command line:
    E471: Argument required
    Press ENTER or type command to continue

&#x200B;

If I press enter am then presented with vim with \~/.config/neomutt/config/vim/vimConfig open in the buffer. I can edit it but don't seem to be able to save the edits (if I edit it and save, then open the same file from the terminal (not neomutt) the edits haven't happened). Once I close this buffer vim exits, so I never get a chance to edit my email. 

What's going on? What am I doing wrong? The problem disappears if I just use 'vim' as my editor in neomutt (without the extra start script).

I'm using `vim-easymotion` and found it useful. The plugin also suggests advance search by

    map / <Plug>(easymotion-sn)

With original search (`/`) I was able to paste a clipboard string (ctrl-shift-v in my terminal), but this function doesn't allow it and it's very annoying. A clipboard string suddenly directly goes into the buffer.

Since the advance search, though, seems useful, I'd like to fix instead of giving up. Does anyone know this behavior and solution?

I'm not sure if it is neovim issue.

1. I showed copy/paste works well (`copy paste works` text).
2. I copied a word `copy`. (please ignore blue auto-highlight)
3. With the original `?` command, I could paste the clipboard text `copy`. You can see all words are highlighted with yellow background. This works the same with the original `/`.
4. With the override `/` command, even while the cursor is after `/` in the command line, if I paste, then the clipboard text directly goes into the buffer.

I've been struggling quite some time now trying to find how to use regexp for vimscript. I've looked at the documentation but I think two things are inconsistent and I'd like to know why.

Let's say I have asterisks all over the place (I'll represent spaces as . and tabs as -)

`*...........*-*-*.some text`

`............*..-*.........*.some text`

`--*........*.some text`

If I do a search:

`:g/[ \t]*[*\( |\t\)\+]\+/p`

It correctly finds everything before ""some text"". This is what I want to achieve. The ""n"" key recognizes every complete match as a single match (3 in total)

However trying to do the same in vimscript through match/matchstr/matchstrpos etc, I get different restuls, or matches not found.

If I do

`:echo match(getline("".""), ""[\s]*[*\(\s\)\+]\+"")`

on top of any line, I always get -1 (not found).

So my question here is: are match patterns different from regular regex? To me it looks inconsistent, but I'd like to know your opinion and if to see if you could point me in the right direction. I suspect the fact of having to use quotes for regex in match pattern makes it different. I've also read about ""magic"" but adding \\m, \\M makes no difference.

I've also tried building the same expression as match pattern, but I have not been able to achieve the same result, I've had difficulties specially when trying to include groups \\(\\) in match patterns.",1584020259.0

I'm hoping this is pretty simple, but I've been scouring the vifm docs and can't figure this out: how do I expand and collapse individual sub-trees in a view?

I naively assumed that I could just do vi-style folding, but it doesn't seem to work that way. tree-view seems to be all or nothing, which is a drag.

Ideally, I'm trying to get this to work like the project views in IntelliJ and Visual Studio, where I can expand or collapse sub-trees as needed and have them stay that way the next time I'm in that project. The fact that there's so little discussion of this in the docs leads me to believe that isn't how this tool is meant to be used, in which case, is there a console-based file manager that plays nicely with vim that would be a better choice for this?

I decided to start again from scratch, and I followed the instructions at [this page](https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Make_Vim_completion_popup_menu_work_just_like_in_an_IDE) on Vim Fandom. They didn't work in my first attempts, but now I noticed that the code contains a number of `\<lt>` that do not look like Vim syntax (but I might be wrong):`inoremap <expr> <C-n> pumvisible() ?

Did anyone managed to get Enter to work as described in the Wiki?Any advice would be much appreciated.

Edit: I found another [Vim Fandom](https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Improve_completion_popup_menu) page with a 'much better' set of commands that just works, and does exactly what it's supposed to do. I'm sharing it here, in case anyone like me might need it:  
`inoremap <expr> <Esc>      pumvisible() ? ""\<C-e>"" : ""\<Esc>""`   
`inoremap <expr> <CR>       pumvisible() ? ""\<C-y>"" : ""\<CR>""`   
`inoremap <expr> <Down>     pumvisible() ? ""\<C-n>"" : ""\<Down>""`   
`inoremap <expr> <Up>       pumvisible() ? ""\<C-p>"" : ""\<Up>""`   
`inoremap <expr> <PageDown> pumvisible() ? ""\<PageDown>\<C-p>\<C-n>"" : ""\<PageDown>""`   
`inoremap <expr> <PageUp>   pumvisible() ? ""\<PageUp>\<C-p>\<C-n>"" : ""\<PageUp>""`

gpanders,Improve Vim's native file history with vim-oldfiles,0.82,False,False,12,fgllr7,vim,https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/fgllr7/improve_vims_native_file_history_with_vimoldfiles/,5,"Hi all,

A while ago I wrote a [simple plugin](https://github.com/gpanders/vim-oldfiles) to improve Vim's native `:oldfiles` command.

`:oldfiles` has a few problems. Firstly, it doesn't have great UX: to actually edit a file from the oldfiles list you use `:e #<N` where `N` is the number in the list. You can use `:browse oldfiles` to get a slightly better interface (you're prompted for a number at the bottom of the page) but it still uses the ""more"" prompt which is not very graceful.

Secondly, the underlying `v:oldfiles` variable is not updated as you use Vim, but is only read on startup and when manually invoking `:rviminfo`.

**vim-oldfiles** is a very lightweight plugin that attempts to solve both of these problems. It provides a new command `:Oldfiles` which will populate your quickfix list with your file history. You can also specify an optional search pattern with `:Oldfiles /pattern/` which will only show results matching your pattern.

I now use the oldfiles feature much more frequently, particularly when I open a new Vim ""session"" and want to re-open a file I was working on earlier.

Enjoy!",1583905111.0

I've only used Visual Studio for this before.

I've managed to setup GVim and clang\_complete on Windows, but clang\_complete doesn't seem to work for the SDL library, which is unfortunate. So I've generated a ctags file (with ctags -R . ) where all the SDL header files are and I've added it to my Vim tag path (:set tags+=sdl\_tag\_file). Problem is, it doesn't show return type, function parameters or anything useful except the name when I press CTRL-N. 

&#x200B;

Preferably, I would get clang\_complete working so I can be rid of tag files, and just get clang to do the work for me whenever i #include a header file.

Also, could someone please tell me where to find info on how to use ctags with an external library such as SDL?",1583900081.0

Jack-o-tall-tales,How can I set certain abbreviations ONLY when I'm in a certain git repo (or any other directory)?,1.0,False,False,2,fgdqdm,vim,https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/fgdqdm/how_can_i_set_certain_abbreviations_only_when_im/,10,"I'm a philosophy student, and I write my essays in vim. I version control them with git. I often have a few (long, technical) words or phrases which come up often in that essay, but not whenever else I am writing, so it's useful to have a list of abbreviations specific to that essay. In practice I have lots of different files in the repo (a plan, a bibliography, maybe subplans, an abstract etc.) all of which the abbreviations would be useful for.

At the moment I just have a dir in my git repo called `.ignore/` (which I tell git to ignore), and put a file called `abbreviations` with my abbreviations in that, then source it from .vimrc. When the essay is done, I delete the source line (but I keep the file and the gir repo, because I keep all of my old essays). 

This works but it isn't very elegant, takes time, and means that the abbreviations are also sourced whenever I load vim anywhere else, which I don't really want. I suppose I could source manually them every time I open vim in that directory, but that would be even worse!

So, I want a way of telling vim 'if I open a file in a git repo, check to see if there is a file `.ignore/abbreviations` and if there is then source it. 

How should I do this?

can I edit a remote file in vim that needs the remote user to use `sudo` / `sudoedit`? 

## Scenario

* pc 1: my local desktop
* pc 2: remote headless server, user has root rights **but** needs `sudo` or `sudoedit` to edit files in, for example, `/etc/`
* I want to edit `/etc/cups/cupsd.conf` **from** pc 1 **on** pc 2 ***without*** `ssh`ing into it first

Normally (*for files I can regularly edit*) I would `vim scp://user@host//home/that_user/some_file.tmp`. However, I cannot `vim scp://user@host//etc/cups/cupsd.conf`, as the user does not have sufficient rights to edit the file without `sudoedit`. 

Yes, I **could** `ssh user@host`, then `sudoedit /etc/cups/cupsd.conf`, but you know how it is. Your local vim is always the best vim. I have *part* of my `.vimrc` on **that** remote host, but certainly not on all my remote hosts; so if I could somehow use my local vim for edition any file on any host, that would make my workflow so much easier.

    nnoremap <Leader>S :sb \|Files<CR>
    nnoremap <Leader>V :vert sb \|Files<CR>

This was simple because with fzf-vim, running Files in Ex mode runs the FZF command and opens the file up.

The problem is: If I escape out of the FZF menu, it carries on with the rest of the command and opens a blank window if I'm doing any of the bottom three commands. 

So I'd like to know if there's a way to take the output of an Ex mode command and put it into a variable so I can then test to see if it's blank, and either do nothing or direct that into another command. So the pseudo-code that I'm thinking of is something like this:

    function! Make_window(prefix)
        let user_input = < call :FZF or :Files here >
        if user_input != ''
            < call ""prefix + user_input"" >

    ╭─user@host [path]
    ╰─$

Because, I embed the path in my prompt, I can use it to avoid nesting Vim sessions inside a Vim 8 terminal buffer when opening files I'm interested in. Here is the code I use for that:

    function! s:TermGetPath() abort
        return fnameescape(substitute(getline(line('.')-1), '\v\S+\s\[(.*)\].*$', '\1', ''))
    endfunction

    "" Switch to normal mode
    tnoremap <C-A> <C-w>N:execute ""lcd "" . <sid>TermGetPath()<cr>:pwd<cr>

As you can see above, I can use `<C-]>` to open Netrw in the `path` directory highlighted in my prompt. Similarly, I can use `<C-p>` to open FZF for fuzzy searching in the `path` directory. Or, I can simply switch to normal mode using `<C-a>` in the terminal, move my cursor on top of a file name and hit vanilla `open file under the cursor` commands (`gf`, `<C-w>f`) to open the file in my current VIM session regardless of where the `path` points to.  Or, even better, I can use `:grep` to search inside the `path` directory and populate QuickFix with the results.

In short, the above setup makes it easier for me to navigate to files inside the prompt path without having to nest new VIM sessions inside the terminal buffer. Hope this is helpful for others as well.",1583575395.0

Looking at: [https://langserver.org/](https://langserver.org/) there are two other options: ccls (which the last time I tried to install on ubuntu 16.04 there was dependency problems) and clangd.  I tried clangd and while it attempts to work on the new codebase, it completely chokes on 80% of the searches (I believe this may be due to the heavy use of the ""using"" keywork?).

I opened VSCode and noticed that the LSP server they are using successfully works on our codebase.  With the promise of LSP being portability of the language servers, I am wondering if anyone knows if we can use their language server in vim?

Finally, after many attempts I'm an (almost) full time vim user.

However, there is still one thing I miss, and it is the ability to usage mnemonics and some visual clues to not have to remember hundreds of keymaps.

What I do usually on VSCode is to just open the omnibar and type whatever I remember from what I want to do, and when I see a result that matches I hit enter and the command is executed.

Doom Emacs and Spacemacs has something close, which is a bottom bar that, once you press space it displays the next tree of options and continues that way until you hit a command.

&#x200B;

I have some things that are close to it, but they are not quite there. For example:   


* I have fzf.vim configured for showing me a fuzzy search of all the available commands, sadly such commands does not have a description, so unless the name is fantastic you will have a bad time discovering commands
* I also have fzf.vim configured for discovering keymaps on a fuzzy way (this is extremely helpful)
* I have installed neoclide COC and coc.lists. They have a fuzzy searcher, but there is one for each kind of thing. So if you want to search for a command you need a keymap for triggering commands, an action? same thing. Usually don't remember in which category falls what I want to use
* And finally there is FZCOC, which uses fzf to wrap coc.lists, but they have the same limitations

So, currently what I do is trigger fzf.vim with commands, Trigger the command that I want (which may open a new popup if it is another list of commands), then search the command and finally execute it. This are so many steps, and I am looking for a more unified experience, where all the commands, along with optional descriptions are in the same place.

I don't mind, for example, If I have to install more coc plugins to put everything under the COC umbrella (for example, git stuff instead of using fugitive), but I don't know if there is such a set of plugins that can work together.

As for now i mostly use vim to code some C++ and i'm not happy with using `<C-x><C-n>` or `<C-n>` for completion as i want some IDE-like features, e.g. whole directory/project indexing, type hints etc etc. Some LSP features like Code Actions, Finding References would be useful to me so i have googled some plugins bringing in LSP support (vim-lsc, LanguageClient-neovim + mucomplete, vim-lsp + asyncomplete, ...) but failed to set any up 😟 nothing has shown when typing something or hitting Tab  
I also have found YCM and coc.nvim but haven't even tried bc i want something lightweight and simple.

I'm also getting weird behaviour where :syntax sync fromstart crashes but reloading with :so $MYVIMRC is near-instant.

And most troublingly, for half of the matches patterns I'm defining, *omitting* the **contained** option results in significantly faster matching.

I have written a short external program that I can run on the file to produce a modified file with <syntaxtypestart> </syntaxtypeend> tags that could be colored in CSS. Is it possible to pipe the result of this into vim for syntax highlighting? 

For more info, this program runs recursively: it takes the file contents as a string, and calls itself on disjoint substrings whenever it finds a match pattern. Even on very large files, this is fast.

2) Is there any way of tricking vim into thinking that e.g. the cursor is on lines 2, 3 and 4 simultaneously and highlighting accordingly?

3) Maybe failing that, I could disable the built in linenumbers and draw one myself.

It is written only using vimscript and uses curl to make requests to slack. It is most useful when vim is compiled with the conceal feature.

Right now you have to call `<leader>l` to reload the channel you are viewing but I will be adding in automatic refreshing using crontab to call a vim function every minute and do this automatically.

-----------------

[Zepl.vim][] is a lightweight REPL integration package for Vim. It provides commands to start and jump to a running REPL, as well as commands and key bindings to send text to the REPL.

[Zepl.vim][] follows several design philosophies:

1. Should be easy to use and configure: not much to learn and very few configuration options.
2. Feel like a part of Vim. Key bindings and commands should work just like the built-in ones.
3. Tiny implementation. (Must not exceed 200 LOC; currently under 160 lines of code.)

There are a couple of known limitations:

- Only 1 REPL can be open at a time (per Vim instance).
- `set hidden` is required for Neovim and will be automatically set.

The pattern in question is:

    let s:pattern = '\m\%(^\|,\)\%(\s*\%([^''][^,]*\)\|\%(''\%(''''\|[^'']\)*''\)\s*\%(,\|$\)\)\@='

The crux of the issue seems to come down to choosing one of the following two inner branches to match either a field that is not quoted, or one that is:

    [^''][^,]*

and:

    ''\%(''''\|[^'']\)*''

If I use only one of these sub-patterns I'm able to match successfully, however combining the two seems to fail for some reason. I've tried every variety of lookaround I can think of to no avail. At this point, I'm ready to give up using an expression and switch to a pushdown automaton.

**current bindings that are like vim**

hjkl for navigation

gg to go to the top

G to go to the bottom

x to delete

o to insert task one line below

**planning to add**

y to copy a task

p to put a task 

**maybe eventually**

dip (delete tasks in parent)

u for undo

r for redo (Ctrl seems unnecessary)

**deviating from vim**

i inserts at the bottom of the list

a shows the action menu for a task

Enter shows the task detail

? shows keyboard shortcut moda

s jumps to search (firefox already uses `/` for page search so didn't want to override)

f shows the filter menu

c clears filters

e goes into quick task edit mode

Space assigns task to yourself (following trello's lead)

1, 2, 3 assigns task as todo, in progress, and done

z to zoom into a task

b to go back from zoom

H to collapse parent task",1582849997.0
jazzmoses,How to map key to change action on press and hold - after key has repeated N times?,0.67,False,False,1,faeee0,vim,https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/faeee0/how_to_map_key_to_change_action_on_press_and_hold/,2,"I want to create the following mapping for j/k keys:

It reminds me a lot to my favorite functionality of VSCode, the git integration. However, this is not as comfortable as it could be. It is targeted at filtering the files and not at navigating the changes. Is there something like this (list of files on the left, preview of git diff on the right) but focused on just navigating the files, seeing the diff and moving around, maybe with the keyboard and everything filling a new screen/tab that you can easily close?

However as someone that hasn't coded a line in my life except editing commands from LaTeX packages im finding it difficult simply setting up Vim so that i can begin actually doing stuff.

As of writing this post i have downloaded and installed MacVim (im on Mac) and downloaded Vim-Latex which most people say is the way to go as far as i know, however i have also found something called Vimtex on github. Whatever is the best i still dont know how to install it on Vim yet. What i need help with is setting up Vim, so that i can do note taking and assignments, like i usually do in LaTeX, and maybe some material on how to get the most out of Vim, such as installing plug-ins and writing snippets.

Considering that im having trouble at this stage should i just quit on Vim, and keep on using VS code? Atom also seems viable and has a guide on the setup on youtube so thats also something im considering.

Short term goals:

1. Setup Vim (LaTeX capability, Pdf Viewer)
2. Write LaTeX files in Vim
3. Setup a master preamble that all my .tex files use
4. Setup a good file management for different Courses and Semesters
5. be able do install plugins

Other goals.

1. Write my own snippets (This would be so awesome!)

This solution has lots of room for improvement: only produce colours for months in use, limit number of colours and chunking dates together, generate nicer sets of colours.

Before I go further, I hoped someone here might know of an existing solution?

I checked some existing plugins:

* Fugitive does something completely different: it tries to [represent hash values as colours](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive/blob/master/autoload/fugitive.vim#L5498-L5516).
* vc.vim doesn't do any different colours.
* [Looks like vcscommand](https://github.com/inkarkat/vcscommand.vim/blob/master/syntax/svnannotate.vim) doesn't do anything fancy.",1582703385.0

For those of you interested in the details, the three parts of this command
are the colon (:), which enters Command-line mode; the q command, which tells
the editor to quit; and the override command modifier (!).
The override command modifier is needed because Vim is reluctant to throw
away changes. If you were to just type "":q"", Vim would display an error
message and refuse to exit:
E37: No write since last change (use ! to override)
By specifying the override, you are in effect telling Vim, ""I know that what
I'm doing looks stupid, but I'm a big boy and really want to do this.""
If you want to continue editing with Vim: The "":e!"" command reloads the
original version of the file.

But adding ! didn't do anything. After entering

> :e $VIMRUNTIME/tutor/tutor!

I got the same error:

I've just recently started using vim. I find the duality of operators and motions very intuitive: it feels perfectly sensible that many of the commands I type have the form ""thing I want to do"" plus ""region I wish to be affected"".

However, the :s command, which is used to find one thing and replace it with another, seems to be an exception to this elegant rule. Although I can type ""**d**10j"" to delete a ten-line function, I cannot type ""\*\*:s/foo/bar/\*\*10j"" to replace ""foo"" with ""bar"" in a ten-line function.

As far as I can tell, this is a fairly simple concept. All that vim would need to do is consider strings of the form "":s/.../.../"" to be operators with normal operator grammar.

Why doesn't vim do this?

—

Here are some possible answers I'm anticipating, all of which I would consider excellent as long as they are true:

* ""There is a command that works like that, it's \[blah\]""
* ""There's no good reason. You can make a command that works like that by putting \[blah\] in your .vimrc file.""
* ""It's actually perfectly natural that vim works like that; you only find it mysterious because you're thinking of it all wrong. You're thinking that \[blah\], but instead, you should think...""

—

Edit: I've realized that my question is going to prompt answers of a different kind, as well:

* ""If you want to replace foo with bar in a ten-line function, you can just use \[blah\].""

If you are about to type an answer of this form, then I want to say that I appreciate your desire to help, but this isn't what I'm looking for. Of course there *is* a way to replace foo with bar in a ten-liner; what I'm wondering is why :s is an oddball exception to the rules — why, in other words, do we:

* use **d10j** to delete 10 lines
* use **c10j** to change 10 lines
* use **y10j** to copy 10 lines
* use **gU10j** to make 10 lines upper case
* use **g?10j** to ROT13 encode 10 lines
* ...
* use **:,+10s/foo/bar** to change ""foo"" to ""bar"" in 10 lines?

Why does **10j** appear in all but one of the commands of the form ""do X to 10 lines""?",1582561902.0

What follows is a plugin question, and yes I've read the doc, and yes I posted on the github issues page, but I bet there's someone here who has a lurking mapping or two with the answer.

# What is a Zettelkasten?

Good question.  Read the post above and watch some videos :).  In the most boiled down sense, it's atomic notes with tags and forward/backward links to related notes.

# What are the challenges of a Vim implementation?

Several.  Auto-generation of back links, maintaining a list of tags, a search mechanism to insert relevant links, and some handy expansions and templates to keep it fast.

# Ok so what's the question?
See edit.  Do a completion but pass through whatever the query was if it's not in the list

# Bonus question

I'd like the command in the edit to auto-trigger when you enter the tabstop for entering tags in UltiSnips.  I think that would require a post-complete or post-jump in UltiSnips, but that's not quite right either.  Any ideas?

Thanks in advance!  If/when I get this done, I'll post up the end product and a demo video.

# EDIT  

This is the fzf command I was looking for, no sleep and misplaced comma:

* I type something in vim
* hit `Escape` to go to normal mode
* Hit a keyboard combination mapped to a command/function
* Have the entire current line passed as command-line arguments to an external command
* Have the entire current line _replaced_ by the output of the command.

[Here](https://youtu.be/jolcXYdLSAU) is a video demonstrating exactly what I want it to look like. In the video, however, the _entire buffer_ is passed through an external command, the one line is replaced, and the _entire buffer_ is replaced. I just want to read/replace the single line.

The goal is to use snippets, but set values.

For example, this works:

    nnoremap ,html :-1read $HOME/.vim/template.html<CR>

This allows me to add the contents of `template.html` at the location of my cursor by typing `,html` in normal mode. However, I _only_ get the contents of `template.html` -- I can't use any placeholders.

What I'd like to do is type some words on the current line in vim:

    apple banana

press a key combination, and have it replaced with this:

    func apple(s string) string {
        return s + "" banana""
    }

assuming I've written a script that accepts two arguments and places them in a template. For example:

    #!/usr/bin/env python3

    import sys

So I've finally realized that vi/vim isn't just that text editor that takes hours to figure out how to exit it, but a nice little text editor that ignores the mouse completely for being too time-consuming and doesn't require a GUI.

Also, I love the fact that I can easily remap keys.
It makes me feel I have full control over my editor and
just by using a dvorak keyboard layout I need to rearrange many of the keys.

Now I'd like to use it as an IDE, in particular for a Vue project.
Because I've felt the slow death of other IDE's (Eclipse), meaning that everything I've learnt from them is becoming useless, plus the popularity of an IDE that I both feel is a temporary free-version of a proprietary program made by a Linux competitor as well as question the longetivity of the company behind it as it has always relied on expensive intel computers while we're heading into the age of cheap ARM SoC's, not to mention it failed on the mobile phone market (MS VS). So I want something that I think will be lasting for a much longer time, thus vim.

Is this possible?

### Yanking does not copy to X clipboard.

## What I have so far

http://vpaste.net/iB2Zl

## [Solved 4 months later]

First, let me say that I've stopped bothering about wanting to switch to new files so quickly,
so I only needed two panes.
For the last four months I've simply used two seperate xfce-terminal windows.

That was until yesterday due to an update that messed with my terminal font.
I got familiar with FiraCode and then Kitty terminal.
Kitty terminal supports tabs and scrolling exactly the way I envisioned it should be.

[from here](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/9vsdmr/setting_up_on_macos/e9f43cx/)

I currently use vs-code and vim for quick edits, though I have found myself using vim a bit more lately. I've been familiar with vim keys for quite a while, and couldn't really do without them now. 

I'm currently going through a few system related things ( changing BSD to GNU stuff in OSX ), and that has led to me looking at vim installs as a result of the message: 

```
vim: stable 8.2.0250 (bottled), HEAD
Vi 'workalike' with many additional features
https://www.vim.org/
Conflicts with:
  ex-vi (because vim and ex-vi both install bin/ex and bin/view)
  macvim (because vim and macvim both install vi* binaries)
Not installed
```


That's a bit of context, and to let the reader know that I'm not completely new to vim. What I'm wondering about though is the title - why would I thank someone for using neovim instead? I thought that it (neovim) was meant to support devs more if they wanted to embed vim or something, but I don't really understand what the benefit would be for myself. 

I hope this isn't a classic flamewar type question, it's not intended to be.

thanks


# edit 

I'll give a little more context - I don't do sysadmin kind of work, or work where I'm SSH-ing into other places a lot (where a vanilla install is typically met). So I'm not too concerned about that kind of thing (though obviously it's valuable to some). I use vundle with a few plugins

problem:

    syn region MyInlineCode contained keepend matchgroup=PreProc contains=TOP start=+<%+ end=+%>+
    syn cluster htmlPreproc add=MyInlineCode
    syn include @HTML syntax/html.vim
    syn region MyInlineHTML keepend matchgroup=PreProc contains=@HTML start=+#inline+ end=+^\s*#endinline;+

Example:

    #inline
    <div> <% $myVar.function() %> </div>
    #endinline;

Notice the `</div>` is marked as an error, and the space after the `%>` claims
to be in `htmlTag` rather than `MyInlineCode`. What is going on here? How can
I have `<%` and `%>` highlighted as pre-processor without breaking the
surrounding HTML syntax?

FeetlessColon,Questions about auto-indentation in vim,0.67,False,1582195087.0,1,f60hc1,vim,https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/f60hc1/questions_about_autoindentation_in_vim/,13,"The only setting I've set concerning *auto-indentation* is `set autoindent`(9)^(1), but when I turn it off, the *auto-indentation* is still there. All `:set autoindent?`, `:set smartindent?`, `:set cindent?` say that they're not set, so something else must be causing the *auto-indentation*.

I figured out that *indentexpr* is causing my *auto-indentation*, because when I `:set indentexpr=""""`, the *auto-indentation* is all gone, but I'm not setting it anywhere in my [*vimrc*](https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/9TPt36tZq2/) file.

I've also [read online](https://stackoverflow.com/a/18671756/11943796) that `filetype plugin on`(33) might be causing this, but when I remove it, nothing changes.

After testing a bit, I found, that by removing these lines(35-39) in my [*vimrc*](https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/9TPt36tZq2/) file:

    call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')
        ...
    call plug#end()

The *auto-indentation* is gone! Which must mean, that either my plugins, or my [*vim-plug*](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) is causing the *auto-indentation*. After some further testing, by deleting all the plugins, I debunked the possibility of plugins causing this, so this means, that actually my [*vim-plug*](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) is causing this!

But the thing that bothers me the most is, that with this *auto-indentation*, when I type in <(-CR> in a *python* file, two new indentations are added in a new line, wtf? The reason it bothers me so much, is that my [parentheses auto-completion plugin](https://github.com/cohama/lexima.vim)'s *(I used to use lexima, but it's too much for me)* feature, where <(-CR> should close the parentheses in a new line, with no indentation, instead adds two new indentation lines, in a new line!

As far as I know, no python style-guide allows this, so why would this happen?  Also, in a python file,  `:set verbose indentexpr?` returns `.../vim/vim80/indent/python.vim`, which means that no plugins are interfering with the auto-indentation.

# So my questions are:

* Why is *indentexpr* automatically set in my vim? *\[Answered* [*here*](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/f60hc1/questions_about_autoindentation_in_vim/fi1xbox?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) *by* u/Jorengarenar, *thank you!\]*
* Why doesn't autoindent do anything when *indentexpr* is not set?
* Why does vim-plug cause auto-indentations and how do I tell it not to?
* Why would <(-CR> add two new indentations in a new line? *\[Answered* [*here*](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/f60hc1/questions_about_autoindentation_in_vim/fi214kl?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)*\]*

About 400,000 words across 500 files.

One thing that bugged me in the past was linking between notes, so I can chain ideas together (have tried in the past, but inspired recently by watching [How to take smart notes](https://vimeo.com/275530205)). Despite using vim for about 8 years, I've never really put much effort into writing my own vimscript. That's changed lately, which led to an epiphany...

    function! s:copy_filename_as_mdlink()
        let fname=expand(""%"")
        let @a=""["" . fname . ""](./"" . fname. "")""
    endfunction
    autocommand BufLeave * call s:copy_filename_as_mdlink()

Then, whenever I change buffer, I *automatically* copy the name of the file I was just in, letting me either `""ap` to paste the contents of the `a` register (where I've just created a markdown link), or more typically, `<c-r>a`, to paste the `a` buffer while in insert-mode.

I *may* even extend this process with something like:

    au BufNewFile *.md,*.txt execute 'normal ""ap'

To automatically insert the link to the file I just came from... (or maybe I'll wrap `:e` so that I can do this optionally...)

I have a text block like this:
```
Lorem ipsum dolor
sit amet, consectetur
adipiscing elit
sed
do eiusmod
```
I already know that it is possible to append something to the end of this (ragged) text block by doing `<C-v>` selecting the text, hit `$` and `A` and add something to the selection (like missing semicolons if the text would be source code):
```
Lorem ipsum dolor;
sit amet, consectetur;
adipiscing elit;
sed;
do eiusmod;
```
Now my question is: how can I do the opposite action for example delete the semicolons at the ragged end. I know that something like this could be done with a visual line selection and a substitution command but I'm looking for something more ""interactive"", especially for cases when I don't want to delete just simple stuff like single semicolons but entire words. Is a multi cursor plugin the way to go and if yes which one? Or is there another ""vim way"" of doing that?",1581828914.0

My main issue with using Vim for writing even short non-programming blocks of text such as a paragraph is that, whereas WYSIWYG programs like Word implement soft wrap so that you can use the arrow keys to go up or down a multi-line soft wrap block of text, in Vim, you can only go up or down lines that are hard wrapped. So for this paragraph which contains no hard wraps, if I was writing this in Vim, I couldn't just use the arrow keys to go up to the word directly above this one (""was"").

Any advice on this? Maybe I should just use a normal LaTex editor? Thanks",1581822816.0

I just thought I'd let everyone know that if they want to get an issue in ALE fixed desperately, or to get a pull request merged, please just put a comment somewhere in GitHub, and I might actually have look now.

I've been incredibly busy with (very good and very positive) life stuff over the past year, so I haven't had much time for managing ALE. I think I'm finally getting to a point where I don't have to be nearly as busy any more, so I can finally work on ALE again. I just made the decision to delete all 424 unread emails in my ""ALE"" email inbox and start again, so I can actually get back on top of emails again.

I'll install the ""stale"" bot for pull requests _only_ so they either get merged or closed from now on, and I'll try to focus on making the improvements to ALE that I want the most, as that's what I'm best at. If anyone wants to help out with managing issues or pull requests, just leave a reply here, a private message on Reddit, or drop me an email at dev@w0rp.com, and we can discuss it.

&#x200B;

Long time Vi(m) user since the Irix times on SGI machines.A couple of weeks ago, I finally decided to spend some time digging a bit more into customizing Vim (thanks, random post on r/vimporn!) and I feel like I've discovered a new world.

I am sincerely impressed by the amount of functionality that can be achieved just by using the Vim scripting language.

With that, of course, comes a bit of frustration because there's a jungle of choices, options, and customizations.

At this point I think I've settled with a minimal set of plugins that gives me pretty much what I need, basically: Nerdtree, autopairs, and vim-lsp with asyncomplete.

The autocomplete so far is the most annoying bit, since I can't manage to find peace. Initially, I've tried jedi, but the lag was killing it for me, so when I discovered the combo vim-lsp/asyncomplete I was really happy... for a while.

I realized that with vim-lsp I couldn't show one of the most useful features that I found in jedi: realtime function signature preview, as I type. The pic show that I can see the signature of the functions for some modules (not for SWIG wrapped ones, for example?), this disappear after selecting the suggestion.

I heard there might be issues with the autopairs, but I've tried disabling it with no avail.

Does anyone has a suggestion (either an alternative to vim-lsp or a customization) for how  to fix this?

I was using a conventional IDE in one of my courses, and realized that there is a feature that would be very useful to me. It's one of those error indicators where the error shows up at the right side of the screen, where the column represents the entire document(as opposed to syntax highlighting showing it at the exact line). So it shows you in the scope of the entire document the error, so you can jump to an approximate location. I realize that it works better with applications with scrollbars, but I still think it would be useful. If it doesn't exist, I figured I might as well take  a crack at writing a plugin for it. I just wanted to make sure it doesn't exist beforehand. Thanks!

the last few days I tried to add autocompletion to my  vim, to me seemed like coc.nvim is the best tool to use after reading various blogs post.

&#x200B;

Now the problem is that I don't seem to be able to get it working correctly, does anyone know how to or a guide to set it up for python development ?

With the default installation of coc.vim + coc-python, it uses jedi, but everytime jedi is telling me that it got a Stream closed error and so it doesn't work.

But if I disable jedi, it should and does download the MPLS, and I would like to use it. The problem is that gd jump to definition no longer works, is it not supported in MPLS ?

If anyone has a guide or some .vimrc that make vim autocomplete python correctly that's the only thing I miss for my setup and I'm getting stressed about that it doesn't work python autocompletion.

full disclosure: I'm running vim in an Ubuntu vm under ESXi. The server is extremely beefy, OS is on an SSD with plenty of cores, plenty of ram, and not under any load whatsoever. But nevertheless I think this could be a vm issue, so my apologies if this isn't technically a vim question.

When I hit ctrl-P, it hangs under ""scanning included file"", for a good 5-10s. It stops on a particular file /usr/include/bits/stdint-uintn.h (which is only 1.1kb), for the longest, but it hangs on others to. Then ~10s later I can type again.

Has anyone dealt with this, and what are my options? I would be fine with excluding my /usr* from searching. I've ensured that all the VM settings are set to max performance, no throttling or IO quotas, so I dont know what else to try. It sucks because I'm really liking ESXi but this kind of gimped performance gives VMs a bad name. I've never seen this when running linux natively, worst is sometimes a 1-2 second pause.

```
if exists('$TMUX')

I am currently an Emacs user (found Emacs about 1 month ago). I'm really getting annoying tho cause there are bugs that happen in Emacs and it really pisses me off!

I never tried Vim and I thought I'd give a shot! BUT! I have spend TONS of hours on configuring Emacs the last month (trust me, you have NO idea how many). And I don't want to do the same with Vim and then get disappointed in the end. So I'm gonna make some questions and thanks for anyone that will spend their time to answer me!

1. How does Emacs compare Vim. I've heard people saying that Emacs is more powerful than Vim? Is that true? And if yes, what Emacs can't do that Emacs can. I have to be clear tho. I'm not talking about thing like being able to open a terminal inside emacs, a browser etc. I'm only talking about text and programming related stuff!

2. A small list. How Vim does on this things? 

* Does Vim has a beautiful UI, including a bottom line, a beautiful theme (in the atom colors) etc.
* What about Live syntax error checking and highlight (SUPER IMPORTANT)?
* Auto complete (not so important but it would be cool)?
* Does Vim has Snippets like Emac's Yasnippet (ALSO VERY IMPORTANT)?
* Does Vim let's you remap EVERY single key? I don't like HJKL for example and i want to use IJKL
* How the window (spited screen) and buffer (opened files) system work on emacs?
* Are there packages that expend Vim's capabilities like on emacs or something similar?

3. Can Vim be a powerful, fully capable IDE for every language as Emacs? On of the reasons I've chosen Emacs when I was founding for an Editor about a month ago is that people said Vim is great for small editing and Emacs is great to used as a powerful programing Editor/IDE. After using Emacs I can confirm the Emacs part but I want people to tell me about the fully capabilities of VIM!

I'm making some software that needs to know the location of the cursor and the path to the file in the currently open buffer.

# Question
**What is the best way to frequently send small amounts of information to a running program?**
It should preferably not require synchronization/blocking on either end.

# Current VIM solution
My quick-and-dirty solution is to write to a `cursor.pos` file on the `CursorMoved` autocmd that I can `scanf` from my program. This works, but noticeably slows down the editor when moving e.g. across multiple lines.

# Solutions for other editors
In Notepad++ plugins are DLLs (`.so` equivalent for Windows), so I can use the standard [interprocess communication tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ipc/interprocess-communications) available through the Windows API in C(++). I currently have it using a named pipe between the plugin and my software, which seems to work without noticeable slowdown.

ryvnf,I have mixed feelings for Vim9 script. What do you think about it?,0.88,False,1580837262.0,65,ey91bd,vim,https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/ey91bd/i_have_mixed_feelings_for_vim9_script_what_do_you/,63,"## Introduction

I just found out that experimental support for Vim9 script [has been merged](https://github.com/vim/vim/pull/5530) to Vim's master branch.  Vim9 script is an entirely new version of the Vim programming language.  The differences are documented [in a help file](https://github.com/vim/vim/blob/master/runtime/doc/vim9.txt).  Among other things it features:

* A new function definition syntax using `:def` with new semantics
* New more efficient calling conventions for functions using the new declaration syntax
* New scoping rules and semantics for `let`
* Optional static typing
* `import`, `export`
* Classes

## My feelings for the changes

I personally dislike these changes.  Vim script is a language with a few quirks, which can take a while to learn to use efficiently.  Now there will be two different version of the language coexisting with different syntax and semantics.  I personally think the original Vim script worked quite well for its use case if one took the time to learn it, and it seems to me that the direction is to make it more into a general purpose programming language, which I think it shouldn't be.

I was initially excited when reading the announcement on what is being worked on for Vim9, which included improving Vim script as a language and improving its performance.  But this wasn't what I expected.

## My Expectation for optimizing Vimscript

I had more expected that they would optimize existing Vim script code.  Like making a function like the following:

    func Sum(list)
        let sum = 0
        for i in a:list
            let sum += i
        endfor
        return sum
    endfunc

Be optimized so that the argument won't be passed by dictionaries anymore, which I thought would be possible to do with a smarter compiler.

## Some reason why I don't the Vim9 script approach

The old Vim script from thousands of plug ins will never go away, so both languages has to coexist.  I think this will be quite bad and confusing for people who want to learn Vim script and have different versions which different semantics.  I also don't want to have to relearn everything to get the performance improvements by the new calling conventions.

As a developer who have released [one plugin](https://github.com/ryvnf/readline.vim).  I feel like it still makes more sense to code in the regular Vim script to preserve compatibility with older Vim versions.  For most plugins the performance improvement of Vim9 script probably isn't worth sacrificing compatibility for.  I probably think there are other plugin creators think the same.  This will probably also stand in the way for widespread adoption of Vim9 script.

## Summary

I liked Vim script for what it was, even with its quirks.  Vim9 script feels like an attempt to strap a general purpose language on to it.  This makes me feel a bit sad and disappointed.  I would have wanted improvements to Vim script which were backward compatible instead, not something that would require learning a new language.  There are already other general purpose languages like Go which is getting used more and more to create Vim plugins.

It also seems sad to me that the thousands of existing plugins will see no noticeable performance improvements, as the focus has been to make Vim9 script fast.

Sorry, if this is a bit ranty.  This change wasn't the way I expected.  Sense it has already been merged, it probably isn't going to change.  Still, I feel like I wanted to write my opinions and maybe hear your opinion.

kace91,"resources for people who learned vim as a ""language"", but not as an environment?",0.2,False,False,0,exyufz,vim,https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/exyufz/resources_for_people_who_learned_vim_as_a/,5,"So, I discovered vim about a year ago, and decided to give it a try. I pushed through the initial learning curve by toying at home and later I decided to integrate what I learned into my workflow, by using vim extensions for my regular editors at work (vs code and intellij, mostly).

Ever since then, I've grown to like my setup, and I would like to move to the next level by trying to use pure vim. The issue is that even though I know how to edit a text file with vim quite well, I know nothing about moving beyond the concept of a single text file. I mean things like:

- how open files, move between them, search a specific one in a project, etc.
- how to move in an ide like manner (things like go to a function's definition, or check where a function is being called, in a project-wide level)
- how to keep several files visible at the same time, resize the panes, move between them, etc
- how to interact with a terminal
- how to use a debugger, if it's possible

I think you get the idea. I've tried to find information about it, but most of what I find is just either 101 basic tutorials for using  as a  text editor (the part I already know), or people sharing their very opinionated setups with a dozen plugins tailored to their liking. While I guess I'll end up having my own similar setup, I would like to start by learning the ""pure"" way of doing all of those things first.

Can you guys point me to a good resource to learn what I'm searching for?",1580721190.0
CoolioDood,:drop <file> without changing the argument list?,0.66,False,1580687156.0,1,exxms1,vim,https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/exxms1/drop_file_without_changing_the_argument_list/,2,"I'm trying to figure out how to use `:drop` without changing the argument list. I already have a working solution, but I feel like it could be better.

In short, I'd like to use a command that either opens a file, or if the file is already opened, switches to the tab/window containing the file -- `:drop` seems to fit this. The issue I have is that `:drop` overwrites the argument list with whatever file it receives, and I'd like to preserve the args list.

I came up with a custom function, particularly for editing my vimrc, that essentially saves the args list, `:drop`s into the file, and then restores the args list:

    function! DropPreserveArgs()
      let s:args = argv()
      drop $MYVIMRC
    
      "" I can't just use :args here because 
      "" that would switch to the first file in the list
      argdelete *
      exe ""argadd "".join(map(s:args, {_, arg -> escape(arg, ' ')}))

      unlet s:args
    endfunction

I'm doing the string processing in `argadd` because `argv()` retrieves the args with unescaped spaces, and `:argadd` accepts space-separated paths.

It works, but what I'm doing is super inefficient and could take a while with a large list.  I feel like there *has* to be a better way, I just haven't found it. I tried to google for a solution but either I'm the first one with this problem (unlikely), or I can't find the right words to search. So I figured I'd ask here. 

Any suggestions?

The problem is that the above just prints `My_cr_func1()` when I press `<CR>` in insert mode. What I want is to have the `My_cr_func1` function run. 

I could just call the `My_cr_func` and not append it to `r`. But, at the end, I check for the content of `r` and if I just call the function it will be empty and the conditional at the end will be true which is not what I want to happen.

I *suppose* my server needs to be active and it isn't, but how to _actually_ do it is beyond me. Here are the steps I took:

- install `python language server` (on arch, `community/python-language-server`)
- install relevant plugins (I use vim-plug):
```
Plug 'prabirshrestha/async.vim'
Plug 'prabirshrestha/vim-lsp'
```
and add the recommended lines to my `vimrc`:
```
if executable('pyls')
    au User lsp_setup call lsp#register_server({
        \ 'name': 'pyls',
        \ 'cmd': {server_info->['pyls']},

    893.35
    5420.70
    2967.32
    671.40
    
After making a visual selection, I know that I can write them to a filter and use `awk` to calculate and display the sum:

    :'<,'>w ! awk '{ sum += $0 } END { print sum }'

I can overwrite the current selection with the sum:

    :'<,'>! awk '{ sum += $0 } END { print sum }'

I can copy it to my system clipboard (MacOS) and then paste it in with `""*p`:

    :'<,'>w ! awk '{ sum += $0 } END { print sum }' | pbcopy

But it seems like I must be missing the way to write that value into my document (or save it to a register or variable) without using the system clipboard (e.g. on a machine without a system clipboard available) and without overwriting the selected text. What am I missing? TIA!

EDIT: Interestingly, I figured this would have a more obvious solution, but from the responses so far it looks like the most straightforward solution is to duplicate the source data, then use a filter (which will replace the duplicate). In which case, in my mind it may actually be easier to just use the filter, yank the result into a register, undo to recover the source data, and paste the register.

EDIT2: Just found [another alternative](https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Capture_ex_command_output):

    :redir @a
    :'<,'>w ! awk '{ sum += $0 } END { print sum }'
    :redir END

Now register `a` will have the command output (plus a little cruft) and can be pasted wherever.

EDIT3: I think my favorite so far:
- yank selection (will end up in unnamed register `:help """"`, or choose a specific register)
- `:let foo = system(""awk '{ sum += $0 } END { print sum }'"", @"")`
- `:put =foo`",1580084945.0

I have a buffer with a file. I would like to traverse the commit history and see the previous revisions of that file in two ways:

1. Side by side diff with the current buffer version
2. Just the complete previous version without any diff

From cmd I would use for instance git log -p path/to/file. Important thing is to limit the diffing and commits to that particular file to keep it clean.

It seems that Fugitive.vim's functionality has changed. If I understand my googlings correctly, in some previous versions of the plugin :Glog -- % would have given me the result I want.

So how to achieve this? Easy way to see previous versions of the file in the current buffer.

For context, I haven't dived head-first into terminal vim, instead opting for the extension available in VS code. This fluidity gained has not been without exception . I have been trying to do things the vim way mostly, and have found the non-vim way to be superior in certain circumstances.

For instance, copying and pasting with cmd+c and cmd+v is just so much smoother when it's a quick operation. For comparison, the vim way would be to yank a word into the clipboard register, then paste it somewhere (eg. search). This operation is \`""+yiw\` just to copy. Is it really quicker the vim way?

With something like vim it would be perfectly understandable that the learning is slow at the beginning, but if you subscribe to the vim way entirely, you will have speed gains in all areas. However, I still don't see how 5 keystrokes could possibly be preferable to \`cmd + c\`

The way I see it, vim's main draw is saving keystrokes and allowing you to edit in a way that is more declarative. I don't see either of these aims being fulfilled by doing things the vim way.

Here are some other non-vim methods I have been preferring:

* \`cmd + /\` to comment out lines, rather than \`gcc\`
* \`cmd + shift + f\` to search an entire directory
* \`option + up/down\` to move entire lines",1579940738.0

I've been using VSCode for a while, but then I decided to go back to (neo)vim because I really miss its configurability and better key bindings (yeah, I was using VIM plugin in VSCode, but DX is not comparable).

I've recently installed Fugitive plugin to work with git and I'm particularly interested on reviewing my changes before committing. I know that we have the inline-diff in Gstatus, but I prefer to view those changes as Gdiff.

The only annoying part is that each time I want to check the next file, I need to go back to G buffer and select the next one. Not a lot of work, but is there any way to make it a little faster and diff the next file?

I guess I could have a macro or something, but I wonder if I'm just missing something...

After adding the after/ftplugin/vimwiki.vim file with the content

    autocmd BufEnter \*.md setlocal syntax=markdown

when I open a vimwiki note (or a diary entry or the wiki index) the syntax is still set to vimwiki. The output of the command :verb set syntax? is:

    syntax=vimwiki

        Last set from /usr/share/nvim/runtime/syntax/syntax.vim

If I then refresh the file with :e or open a new window and come back to the vimwiki buffer then the autocommand is triggered and the syntax is set to markdown.

My impression is that the autocomand set with the ftplugin file is set but has no effect until you enter the buffer the next time.

Can anyone throw some light on this and help me fix the problem?

So now my buffer list is 1 - the file I'm working on and buffers 765 and 766 which contain some random low-level script output.

**\[\[Edit: Solved -->** vimwiki was overwriting my foldmethod, apparently because it doesn't work nicely with foldmethod `marker.` You have add `let g:vimwiki_folding=expr` to vimrc, and then it has its own folding system, which works better anyway, and doesn't require littering your wiki files with additional {{{1 marks.  ignore the rest of this post **\]\]**

It's kinda annoying to have to enter that every time though. Does this mean my autocmd is getting over-written somehow?

I tried removing the plugins that might be doing that and that didn't change anything.

The thing is that vim is probably the fatest editor I can use when it comes to edit configuration files. It feels so awesome to just type \`ciw\` to replace an entire word and move one line down and just repeat by pressing dot. I feel like a magician using vim and it is an awesome experience. 

However, I feel like a completely different person when I try to edit code using vim style: The problem I have to fix becomes a secondary problem and I spent most of the time thinking about which vim command should I type to the level that I am almost unable to write any useful code using vim.

I tried all kind of editors with vim emulation, spacemacs, vim with dozens of plugins.... but nothing seems to make vim suitable for coding ( in my personal situation of course).

It is very frustrating because I want to  use vim in as many aspects of my life as I could, but every time I try to use it on my actual daily job I fail, and It's been like this for years (almost a decade)

So what frustrates me about vim is that it is my favorite editor, but I can not use it as much as I could... Recently I invested money in Onivim 2 to see if it fulfills the promise of brin vim to the modern editor era...

Pressing `q` just quits. `Enter` jumps to a link and backspace goes back. So many plugin help files start with a contents page so I find myself doing `<leader>l` followed by (count)`n` to go to the link, hit `<CR>` read a bit hit `<BS>` then do (count)`n` again to go to then next link and so on.

The canonical way of doing these mappings would be to add it as a filetype in .vim/ftplugin but I like to keep everything in my .vimrc.

My biggest problems with it:

- Too many integrations for too many plugins I don't use
- Integrates through global variables with a fixed list of plugins (no interface to integrate a plugin that isn't on the list)
- Colored in its own way, so you need to use colorschemes that vim-airline-themes plays well with
- I don't really like Unix ricing culture, beyond the basics;  too many rices add dependencies that ruin a system's performance, portability and minimalism/usability (case in point, a thousands-line codebase for a fancy statusline is pretty ridiculous, IMO)

Really, I only need a couple of things on top of the stock statusline:

- Integration with Fugitive to show me which Git branch I'm on
- Integration with Obsession to show me whether or not I'm in a session
- Display filetype
- Don't include too much of anything I don't need

Therefore, I've taken on Tim Pope's [vim-flagship](https://github.com/tpope/vim-flagship), which I'm much happier with. I get to use autocmds instead of the oddly C-biased quasi-scanf interface that Bram decides to tack onto everything, and I get a few other global variables that I can mess with.

For anyone who uses Airline/Lightline, but is willing to rethink how much value the rice actually adds and might consider something with a smaller footprint, I highly recommend you take a look at the stock statusline. If that fails you for similar reasons that it's failed me (quasi-scanf interface, lack of transparency with global variables), consider Tim Pope's vim-flagship.",1579368758.0

I have been using Vim daily for a little more than a year now, and although I think I am ""fluent"" enough for most of my daily tasks, I have noticed that I have not been progressing much (as in learning new commands or new usages of commands I already know) over the last few months.

To solve that, I decided to read more of the details of the documentation and put them in practice.

I started with the `:substitute` command and wrote a little article on what I didn't know before but found useful over the past week or so (I am sure the rest has its uses too... I just did not find any!).

I talk about:

* The `g`/`c`/`n`/`&`/`r` flags
* Repeating substitutions, including the difference between repeating a *search* pattern and repeating a *substitute* pattern
* Using `\=` to do fancier replacements

While this is mostly aimed at fellow ""intermediate"" vimmers and might seem obvious to more experienced ones, any feedback would be greatly appreciated (especially since it's my first time writing about Vim)!

Even with dedicating 2 days in figuring out YCM I haven't still figure it out to work properly. For python I need modulewise autosuggestion which seems like impossible thing to begin with, and YCM could not satisfy the need. And I need JS framework based suggestion which seems impossible too.

I need VIm because I have slow and old PC in the first place. With YCM I seem to have bloated it.

How do I go back to the good old days now with WSL? Will straight up uninstalling WSL purge all the app installed? I have no problem with that.

Edit:

If you could also answer this question that would be great -

How do I reduce the length of indentation in Vim. Compared to VScode the indents in writing HTML files are atleast two folds.

And how do I auto format HTML files?

**Edit:**

Thanks to u/Nazeeh 's comment below, I was finally able to get it working.

First, I downloaded [universal-ctags](https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags-win32/releases) for Windows and added it to PATH.

Second, I installed the Vim plugin manager [Vim-Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) (for easily installing plugins).

Next, I installed the [Tagbar](https://github.com/majutsushi/tagbar) plugin.

The command works fine, but I wonder now how I can integrate this bit of functionality into existing plugins that I use. For instance, I rely on [wincent/commant-T](https://github.com/wincent/command-t) and [tpope/vim-projectionist](https://github.com/tpope/vim-projectionist) for my navigational needs. Of course, I could ask the authors for help or maintain my own fork however I wonder if there is a simpler and less intrusive way? For instance, can I teach vim to simply use my `:SPlist` command whenever it needs to execute a `:split` or `:vsplit` command? To my understanding, the split commands can be issued in two ways:

1. via vim's commandline
2. internally from a vimscript using the `execute` command

Solution for 1. is simply a matter of introducing a commandline map, it's 2. that I am not sure about and need help with. Any guidance is much appreciated!

I want to use vim at my new job but there are some problems and I would like your suggestions on how to approach them.

First of all, allow me to explain my setup. There are some servers running our product. Those servers are not running linux but actually another version of unix with different architectures. Due do those problems, I can't compile/run the code/tests in my dev machine, I have to connect to one of the machines we have available to compile/run what we're building and do it over there. 

My first/current solution was to use a vim-sftp plugin and once I save my files on vim it uploads it to the server and I just alt+tab to my terminal emulator connected to it and do what I need. 

This solution has been working for a few months now but I'm running into some problems with YouCompleteMe and some other different auto-completion plugins that I tried. Since all the files/dependencies don't exist in linux (that's why I can't compile it locally), I downloaded the source files and told YCM to use them as dependencies. Unfortunately, some things don't work properly, like the GoToDefinition, etc. At least 50% of the time it doesn't work.

I did set up the remotely machine so I could develop on it. There, I could just use the compile\_commands.json that cmake did output for me. I tried ALE with that and it works flawlessly. The bad thing is that developing remotely is reaaally slow and I just can't keep doing that.

Sorry if this is too big, I just tried to explain as much as I could.

TL;DR/Long story short: The software I'm working with only compiles in some machines because they have dependencies unavailable on linux, so, I have to develop locally, push my files to the remote machine and build/run tests over there.

However, I've recently felt the need to open multiple `terminal` splits per project so I've been trying to come up with a different solution to support this.

&#x200B;

The approach has been to define a set of commands that can be used to open new horizontal/vertical `terminal` splits from already existing ones only. The functions that these commands call will then store information in a list about how each buffer was opened, the buffer number, etc. Then, the toggling process is as simple as determining if the set of terminal windows is open, going to each, and executing `hide`. Otherwise, if they aren't showing I can simply iterate through the list and open them in the same order, producing the same layout as before. The list might look like:

    [{'bufnr': 2, 'type': 'root'}, {'bufnr': 3, 'type': 'v'}, {'bufnr': 4, 'type': 'h'}]

This is all fine and dandy as long as the only `terminal` buffers that are closed are the ones at the end of the list. I have some special logic to deal with closing ones in the middle, but there are *way* too many edge cases in this simplistic method I've come up with.

The point in this post is to look for advice on the best way to achieve what I want, or discover something better that already exists.

1. using NETRW  there is a directory under my cursor so on designated keybinding open all files in that directory in new tab with each file vertically / horizontally splitted (ignore subdirectories in that directory)
2. using NETRW we visually selected some files so on designated keybinding open all selected files in new tab each file vertically / horizontally splitted

let's say the keybinding would be

`nnoremap <leader>O doTheGettingPathStuff()`

What i've found so far is this is doing exactly what I want to achieve

`:tabnew | args path-to-directory/* | vertical all`

`:tabnew | args file1.ts file2.ts file3.ts | vertical all`

I noticed that the man page plugin was adding about 220ms to Vim's startup time. I was using the command given by `:help :Man`.

This was problematic, since I like Vim's startup to *feel* instant, particularly because I often use Vim for making quick edits (e.g., writing git commit messages).

Matlab has a ""peculiarity"" where if you want to instantiate the class ""foo"" which is located at `./+package1/+package2/@foo/foo.m` OR `./+package1/+package2/foo.m` you would say `myFoo = package1.package2.foo();` which is annoying because it's hard to complete outside of Matlab's built in editor.  I got some help early on in making a function to add to `gf` so I can open files structured like this, but tools like coc.nvim can't really help with completion unless you actually know the path structure before hand.

FZF is helpful for completion in general, so I thought why not use it for this.  Here's a slick mapping that will do the work of creating Matlabby ""paths"":

```
inoremap <expr> <c-x><c-m> fzf#vim#complete(

Been using vim for coding for years including cscope/ctags and plenty of home-brew customisations but code auto completion is something I've never got around to. So what recommendations for plugins do you have (and why) for me to become a code completion power user. Main languages that need support are C/C++,  Python and javascript. 

Something that can take account of a large set of compile switches (-D, #define blah I mean) - such as linux kernel config would absolutely nail it.

Neovim compatibility is a nice-to-have.

I have an elementary vim scripting question. I'd like to write a Vim command that does the following:

1. Make a new split.
2. Launch a terminal program.
3. Wait for the program to stop and close the split.
4. Read the output produced in the second step into the original buffer.

This seems like a very common work flow, but I'm having trouble getting it to work. The problem is in steps 3 and 4. As a test I defined:

    function MyExitFunction(a,b,c)   
      close   
      read blah 
    endfunction 

Then did:

    :new | call termopen('fzf>blah',{on_exit:MyExitFunction} 

which does start the terminal and close the split after the program is done. The read  
 command, however, seems to do nothing. What should I do to get the  program output into the original buffer?

The first command deletes every line without the string `foo.` The second command uses substitution on the remaining lines to remove anything that comes before and after the hyperlink.

The process uses more CPU than usual and the output spits out `828738 substitutions on 828738 lines`. Wait, what?

I ran the commands separately and they worked without any slowdown as you'd expect. I did some searching but haven't found an answer on why this happens. Though I did find an alternative.

`d` is the delete operator.

Motion

* `w` \> excluding its first character.
* `e` \> Including the last character

pressing `e` at first goes to the end of the first word then jumps to the end of the next words.

pressing `b` will start jumping at the beginning of backward.

`d number motion`

You insert count before motion.

`2dd` deletes two lines.

`u` to undo last command, `U` to fix a whole line and `CTRL + r` for redo.

To put with `p` place cursor above or before.

`rx` replace the underline character with 'x'.

`ce` deletes character at cursor to the end of the word and puts in `insert mode`

`c` is delete and insert.

`CTRL + G` to show your location in the file and file status and information.

`gg` to the top of the file, `G` to the bottom of the file.

Type in line number than either press `G` or `gg`.

`/` for forward search, `?` for reverse search. `n` to find the next searched item forward. `N` goes backward.

`CTRL + o` puts where you had your cursor before, `CTRL + i` goes forward.

`%` to go the ending bracket if you are at the beginning bracket.

`:s/old/new/g` for replace operation within the **line**. Without `g` only changes first occurance. `:%s` replaces throughout the file. You can also do it with ranges of line `:beginning line number,ending line number`then `s`. adding `gc` asks for confirmation prior to replacing.

Running a shell command from vim `:!ls` so, `:!` then command.

Writing files with name `:w test`

Using visual selection to write blocks of code to a seperate file. First select with `v` then, `:` to see the lines selected, then `w test`.

Merging files `:r test` retrieve the file `test` and put in the cursor.

You can also input external command line output this way `:r !ls`.

`o` opens a line a below puts you on insert mode. `O` opens a line above.

For multicharacter replace use `R`. While in replace mode, as you write the underlying characters will be replaced.

For searching with ignore case `:set ic`. To enable highlighting of found words `:set hls is`

Prepand 'no' to switch an option off `:set noic`

`ctrl + w` to jump windows.

`:help user-manual`

Vimrc `:help vimrc-intro`

`CTRL + d` shows the suggestions, `tab` does autocomplete.

Edit:

## Thread suggestions

The suggestions came up in this thread.


`J` brings the bottom line at the end of the current line

`J` is for join with space.

`gJ` is for join without space.

`ciw` changes the inside of the current word

`vi)` Highlights everything inside a bracket. Works with `]` and `}` too.

Visual Inside Brackets > `vib`

Delete Inside Brackets > `dib`

Change Inside Brackets > `cib`

Go(?) Uppercase Inside Brackets > `gUib`

`CTRL + o` and `CTRL + i` are jumps.

`dt<somthing>` delete till <something> and `df<something>` delete find <something>

`cw` change word

`ci""` change inside parenthesis

I wanted my buffers to behave exactly like tabs in Chrome or Firefox when they are closed and I also wanted to prevent the destruction of windows on buffer deletion so I came up with this mapping:

    "" Close buffer (without closing window)
    nnoremap <expr><leader>w len(getbufinfo("""")[0].windows) > 1 ?
        \ "":close<CR>"" :
        \ (bufnr("""") == getbufinfo({""buflisted"": 1})[-1].bufnr ? "":bp"" : "":bn"").""<bar>bd #<CR>""

It first checks if the buffer we want to close is present in more than one window. If so, only the window is closed (just a personal preference, you can remove that check if it's not the behavior you expect). Otherwise it checks if the current buffer is the last one (ie has the highest buffer number). Based on the result, we switch either to the next or the previous buffer exactly like tabs in Chrome/Firefox. Then the buffer we just left is closed. This is done in this order to prevent the closing of any window.

I also display my open buffers using vim-airline's option:

    let g:airline#extensions#tabline#enabled = 1

so that my experience with buffers is exactly like my browser's tabs in the end.

I am a few months deep now and I am absolutely loving it. It is really fun to use. 

Problem is, that is would like to something equally as powerful on my Desktop.

Now vim has one weakness: It is super configurable. Yeah, I know people love that feature but honestly I just can't be arsed to spent hours upon tweaking the config. It is especially bad, as I use a extreme variety of programming languages and having to research the best plugins for every one would leave me with no time for actually writing code. (Not trying to offend people that like tweaking their editors, this just ain't for me.)

Just taking taking someones elses config does not really work that well either because they have build it mostly for their special use cases.

So what are my options for an powerful zero/minimal config text editor that supports (nearly) every programming language under the sun?

Sticking it out and accepting I have to waste hours with configuring? Maybe try Spacemacs, combining the Good of vim and Emacs?

whenever I open a code file (it's java) the syntax is all in white and no coloring at all,  
`:coloscheme default` will revert back to the original syntax highlighting and it's coloring properly, but I want a specific theme so I'd try `:colorscheme darcula` or `:colorscheme angr` and the syntax turns to white again.

However, after a few days of using it, I noticed that in vimtex you can open a fold by going there with your cursor and pressing either the l or h key (movement keys). This is pretty convenient as it is a lot quicker than pressing zo with less movement of the fingers. But the same does not work on simpylfold. Looking through both help files it does not seem to be mentioned in either file.

My question is now, how can I emulate the behaviour of vimtex for simpylfold (or any file with foldings in general). I guess you could map l to a function which checks the foldlevel of the current line and then opens the fold (or not), but that seems a bit laborious. Does someone know a better way?",1578122550.0

This makes it so everytime you press `<space>`, but only in the `/` or `?` searching command lines, you insert a `.*` instead. So now typing `/def foo` can find `def foo` or `def bar(foo)`.

```
cnoremap <expr> <space> '/?' =~ getcmdtype() ? "".*\\_s*.*"" : ""<space>""

This matches any character, followed by one newline, followed by any character (roughly something like that, I'm not a regex expert). You can use this for some crazy visual selections across lines without much thinking about the regex involved. If for some reason you had like:





    def bar
      foo
    end





You can then type `/def<space><space>end` to match the whole thing. Obviously this is a contrived example but I thought it was interesting.

If you want to retain normal usage of `/` but have this option available, you could also make it happen only on `?`:

```
cnoremap <expr> <space> getcmdtype() == ""?"" ? "".*"" : ""<space>""
```

Then to fuzzy search you'd just have to hit `?` remember to swap your `n`s and `N`s. I personally never press `?` and just use `n` and `N` respectively inside of an `/` search anyways.

This might seem like sacrilege to the regex aficionados but I was exposed to the fuzzy searching of sublime before I ever got into vim, so this simple little change is like a life changer for me.

Note credit for some of the vimscript here goes to romainl, as always his vim fu is insane and I found this specific kind of way to cmap only for ? and / and then used it for the purposes of fuzzy searching.",1578102818.0

    Pi is equal to 3.141592653589793 

Another example using `bash`. I wanted a nice header for my `LaTeX` snippets in my `vim.init` file. So, instead of using `figlet` in a separate terminal running bash, I just ran `figlet LaTeX` (by selecting the line and typing `:!bash <CR>`. Which resulted in this:

eliseu_videira,What would be the best way to format this code in vim?,0.95,False,False,20,eil8pv,vim,https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/eil8pv/what_would_be_the_best_way_to_format_this_code_in/,21,"The task i'm trying to accomplish is to remove the number in front of the keyword, enclose with curly braces {} and add an 0 index after it, from line 7 to 37 (starting with 1: ""break"", should be formated as the line above, into { ""break"", 0 }.

This task is pretty straight forward in vscode (the editor that i'm most familiar with), but in vim I couldnt think of a fast way of doing it, that didnt involve some sort of macro (saving keys into qa and then repeating \\@a it for each line). 

I'm interested in seeing how would you guys solve this problem.

liuchengxu,vim-clap: to be a performant fuzzy finder and dispatcher vim plugin,0.98,False,False,124,eiazzo,vim,https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/eiazzo/vimclap_to_be_a_performant_fuzzy_finder_and/,34,"Previously, vim-clap's main feature is the full support of vim's `popup` and neovim's `floating_win`, which brings us a new way of interaction that won't disturb the current window layout. But it was mainly written in pure VimL, making it inherently much slower when searching/filtering at scale(see [\#140](https://github.com/liuchengxu/vim-clap/issues/140)). I have spent a lot of effort to tackle the performance issue of vim-clap. And now I'm very happy to share some good news! With the latest version of vim-clap, the performance issue and the flicker of running async job(I wrongly thought this flicker is hard to fix before) have been completely resoloved! All the heavy job has been handled by the external binary written in Rust. And vim-clap now can deal with even 1 million items decently.

To have a performant and nicer vim-clap, ensure you have Rust installed on your system and then run `:call clap#helper#build_all()` for building all the optional external depdencies.

normal mode =>   **/max**
