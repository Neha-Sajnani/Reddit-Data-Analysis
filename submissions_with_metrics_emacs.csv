Hagge5,Getting rid of extraneous emacs bindings when using evil-mode?,0.81,False,1585578458.0,6,frrny3,emacs,https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/frrny3/getting_rid_of_extraneous_emacs_bindings_when/,18,"Hi,

I'm attempting to learn evil-mode with no previous vi/vim experience. I'm using evil-collection.

I've noticed that all default emacs bindings not overwritten by evil or evil-complete is still there, but this is hampering my learning since I'm occasionally unsure if what I just did is an evil binding or an emacs binding that I just didn't happen to know about, and occasionally I cheat and use emacs bindings I know of when I really shouldn't...

Does anyone know an easy way to get rid of emacs-defined bindings that I shouldn't need when using evil? Any packages? I couldn't find anything on Google, and manually unbinding them one-by-one seems like a huge waste of time.

An example is C-f still being available in the insert state; I would prefer it being unbound, since I don't want to use C-(f|b|p|n) for movement. Or I-Search through C-s being available in the normal state, when I'd rather use / for evil-search-forward.

This is complicated further by there not being just build-ins that I'd preferably want rid of. It also includes stuff defined by packages that's not overwritten (such as helm).",1585606910.0

Desmesura,Emacs and Suckless software are (paradoxically) similar?,0.89,False,False,57,frcysj,emacs,https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/frcysj/emacs_and_suckless_software_are_paradoxically/,71,"Hello,

For a while I've been taking interest in some [suckless](https://suckless.org/) software and the philosophy behind it. From what I understand, their mentality is this: **software should be bare-bones**: only containing the essential, and If you want more features, you patch them to it. Moreover, their software doesn't use config files: you have to alter the files directly and then recompile (or apply some of their patches, in which case you may still have to edit the source code to solve merge conflicts or errors). This is not only for having faster and lighter programs, it is also to **minimize the distance between developer and user**: you end up reading the source code, understanding it and extending it.

I'm sure this sounds familiar to you, fellow Emacs users. **Emacs is sometimes considered bloat**, but in reality it is also pretty bare-bones. Emacs' built-ins provide a great editor and a great programmable/extensible computing environment, but you are expected to extend it yourself or install third-party packages if you want more, extra, features.

These two models differ from other GNU/Linux (or general free software) in that if you use these other programs, chances are you won't extend them, you'll just use them as they are and change some settings in their config files. Even though you obviously have the possibility to do so.

Although Emacs and Suckless tools may have a similar raison d'etre (at least in my opinion!), they **obviously have differences**. Here are a list of some of these differences, or pros/cons of each one, more or less:

* Emacs extension language is Elisp while Suckless tools tend to be written mostly in C (from what I've seen). **Elisp**, being a Lisp, is a higher level language, with higher-order functions, macros, etc. This makes it **more expressive than C**. But, at the same time, **C is much faster**.
* **Emacs being single-threaded** takes a toll on it as you start using it for many more things other than text editing. I don't know that much about computing but I've read before than this is the price to pay to have a Lisp-machine-y centralized model. Please correct me, as I've said, I don't know much about these internals.
* This is maybe more a personal feeling, but sometimes, when I use some parts of Emacs, I can't help but feel like I'm using an **unnecessary extra abstraction on top of the GNU/Linux shell**. And I miss using the command line and shell script where I have a more direct interaction with shell commands/programs. It's kind of hard to explain this one.
* With Emacs, there's **no context switching**. Here, in my opinion, is where Emacs shines the most. You have your text editing commands, macros, search commands, completion engine, help functions, etc. EVERYWHERE. It is truly an amazing feeling. This also makes it much easier to write simple commands for whatever mode you are in using you typical Emacs functions.
* The Suckless ecosystem is much less broad: they have less packages. But here I'm also more or less also comparing ""workflows"", in a sense.

Of course, all these pieces of software are great, this is not a war. It is amazing the amount of time and effort that a lot of people put in developing free software, I am so grateful for this. Also, I'm sure one can be more or less equally productive with both. In the end, these reflections come more from a sense of being more comfortable in one or another model.

I'm sorry for the long post, but this is something I've been thinking about lately and I haven't found any discussion online about this topic. I want to know how some of you feel about this, I'm interested in the opinions of people which have used Emacs or these other packages for much more time than me and know more about these topics.

Have a great day!",1585543535.0
arredi,Using Avy for autocomplete and more?,1.0,False,1585557514.0,5,frc7ki,emacs,https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/frc7ki/using_avy_for_autocomplete_and_more/,3,"Hey there,  


Avy is program designed for convenient movement though a buffer, inspired by easy-motion. This allows you to move the cursor to a point in the buffer. It works by superimposing character over the buffer, to indicate possible location for the cursor to go. This feature would be useful to integrate into the other places in emacs. It could  company's popup menu for example, so that you can get to the appropriate completion in few key presses. As a tool, it would be useful to find ways to integrate it into other locations where text appears in the editor.

I posted it here some time ago. It's now more stable and available from within Emacs using `M-x install-package`. The package's name is `gdscript-mode`.

It replaces the previous package that only highlighted some keywords, and brings features such as:

- Syntax highlighting.
- Code folding.
- Imenu.
- Support for scenes (.tscn) and script (.gd) files.
- Comment wrapping when using fill-paragraph.
- Indentation and auto-indentation: tab-based (default) and space-based.
- Automatic pairing of parentheses, brackets, etc.
- Code formatting using gdformat.
- Auto-completion for all the keywords in the gdscript-keywords.el file.

GDScript now also supports the language server protocol through `lsp`. We'll add a guide to set this up soon.

lafrenierejm,Overlay from show-paren-mode taller than line height,1.0,False,1586061244.0,1,fr9ozc,emacs,https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/fr9ozc/overlay_from_showparenmode_taller_than_line_height/,9,"The height of the overlays on matching parens in `show-paren-mode` are taller than the line itself.  Whenever I move over a matching paren with `show-paren-mode` active, the height of the line increases to compensate for the height of the overlay;  moving off of that character then causes the line to shrink back to its original height, creating a jittery appearance when moving rapidly over parens.

This is occurring even with the `:weight` attribute of the `show-paren-match` face set to `nil` (default is bold), so it doesn't seem to be related to my font.  As far as I know, I don't have anything in [my config](https://gitlab.com/lafrenierejm/dotfiles/blob/master/emacs/init.org) that sets the line height.

Any ideas how to make the height of `show-paren-mode`'s overlay match the height of the line?

**EDIT:** I found out that the height is, in fact, being caused by the bold `:weight` attribute.  For some reason, even after customizing the face and removing the bold weight the height difference remained.  After adding a `:custom-face (show-paren-match ((t (:weight regular))))` argument to my `use-package` for `modus-operandi-theme` and reloading EXWM, the height difference no longer occurs.

This leaves me with two questions:

1. Why is my bold face taller than my non-bold face?
1. Why was restarting Emacs necessary to reset the line height rather than just customizing the face via `customize-face`?

**EDIT 2:** It seems that the font customization I thought was being applied in my `init.org` was not, in fact, being applied.  This despite confirming that the source block was correctly being tangled to `init.el`.",1585532146.0

As with flycheck and other checkers, I would prefer to see all issues without having to move the cursor to the text first.

From what I can tell this isn't possible, so I wrote [flyspell-visible-mode](https://gitlab.com/ideasman42/emacs-flyspell-visible-mode) package to spell check visible text.

This is done lazily, as an alternative to running `flyspell-buffer` on load which locks up Emacs on large files.

So, my question is: should I stay with installing packages the 'default' way, i.e. via `package.el` or should I go with `use-package` straight away. Speaking of **straight**, earlier I used `straight.el` which takes a totally different approach. But because of the intention of my project - learning Emacs from the ground up - I will neglect this package manager for now, I guess.

# Gnus, a Tough Sell
> Its [sic] 2019, the only thing you should be using is notmuch.
>
> &mdash; Uncited redditor

### Marketing Does Matter
Marketing matters, even in the decidedly unglamorous context of
last-century text editors.  When I first heard about ""Doom Emacs"" I admit I was intrigued.  Turns out the Doom project has nothing to do with the cataclysmic end of days or the pioneering FPS of the 90s (this despite Doom's shameless ripping off of the game's splash graphic).  Similarly, Spacemacs's ""intergalactic"" theming and its accessorizing with a fancy website, logo, and ""cool merch"" have done wonders for its brand.

Can such proverbial lipstick be applied to the porcine Gnus?  Prettification runs a tad counter to Gnus's spartan, no-nonsense ethos (this despite a frivolous, mealy-mouthed user manual).  It'd take a lot of work, the cosmetic nature of which is best done by millennials.  And putting my finger to the wind, no one under 35 has heard of, much less cares about, Gnus.

Marketing aside, the 800-pound gorilla menacing potential users though isn't a homely appearance but soul-withering useability.  No one wants to debug their email, and assimilating Gnus without firing up edebug at least once is like learning a manual gearbox without stalling.  If you can manage either, you should fill your bathtub and gingerly step in to see if indeed you're the second coming.

### Impervious to Documentation
The current search results for ""how to gnus gmail"" are sparse and unauthoritative.  At the time of writing, the lead result is an [unstructured braindump](https://github.com/redguardtoo/mastering-emacs-in-one-year-guide/blob/master/gnus-guide-en.org) whose github star count is less indicative of actual usage than fervent solidarity amongst the author's countrymen ([996.icu](https://github.com/996icu/996.ICU) ring a bell?).  My main criticism is the guide's complete glossing over the hardest part, which is not Gnus's notoriously arcane UX, but how to string together systemd, mbsync, and possibly dovecot.  Also clear as mud is accommodating multiple addresses within the same imap service be it GMail or NetEase.  What?  You only have one gmail address?  What guileless person goes through his virtual life boasting a single gmail identity?  Answer: an ubermensch who unabashedly keeps his real-life professional, social, and financial selves linked to a transparent, traceable address... you **are** the son of God!

### Sin #1, Two-timing
Using Gnus just for say RSS and keeping mu4e for GMail betrays an irreconcilable lack of faith.  Like Scientology, Gnus urges giving of yourself wholly and unconditionally.  Unlike Scientology though, Gnus won't demand the same of your wallet.  As fierce a Gnus evangelist as am I, I'd rather the two-timers kick Gnus to the curb and monogamously commit to mu4e.

But the parents of millennials were more likely to have taken their kids to see ""The Lion King"" than ""Reality Bites.""  So millennials have been inured at an early age of ""a la carte"" preferences and inclusion.  Two-timing is *de rigueur* particularly amongst org-mode devotees, a good number of whom only use emacs for task management and demur to a modern IDE for coding.  There is even a [well known elisp blogger](https://nullprogram.com) who uses vi as his primary editor.

The vi editor, I'll make an exception for.  It's the proverbial dagger in your boot when a barren container environment disarms you of your broadsword.  Employing multiple text editors generally though is akin to carrying both an IPhone and Android, and using the latter for one or two Android-only apps.  Or, more colorfully, it's like a busker slinging two guitars, who plays the Fender for his entire set, but unsheathes the Gibson in case the crowd requests ""Stairway to Heaven.""  Or the samurai who laboriously carries two swords, one for combat, and the other for the less frequent task of *seppuku*.  Many would argue he leave the *wakizashi* at home, if only to make it less convenient to off himself, a temptation hard to resist when one's honor blade is so close at hand.

I get that an adjustable wrench is less optimal than a fixed wrench of just the right size, but tooling analogies in the physical world do not hold in the virtual where everything including your tooling is malleable.  Aside: I glitch when a coder is classified an ""engineer.""  That relatively recent label would seem obtuse twenty years ago.  Traditionally, engineers require an empirical understanding of physical phenomena, and your garden-variety coder never took fluid or thermo.

### Sin #2, Manual refreshes
On par with two-timing is running Gnus and working in the same emacs.  Again, lots of people engage in this illicit behavior.  Because emacs sucks at multithreading (i.e., it can't do it at all), the single-emacs *gnuser* must deliberately switch to the Gnus buffer and press `g` to get new messages.  It's like watching my mom type ""email"" in the browser search box to access her Outlook inbox.  Gnus is meant to be run in a separate emacs, and importantly, you **must** add the two lines configuring `gnus-demon` to periodically poll for incoming messages **like a normal mail client**.  If you're retrieving messages in some weird manual way, I urge you to try a conventional program like Thunderbird.  It will blow your mind.  Then once the euphoria of a self-refreshing inbox wears off, try coming back to Gnus with `gnus-demon`.

### And Your Point Is...
Given all the handwringing and self-doubt, why Gnus at all then?  Mail programs are good at filtering out messages you've already read.  Now imagine you could get the same ""unreads"" view for all your news sources.  Your antediluvian copy of ""Netscape Messenger"" can do that but not within the comfy confines of emacs.

Gnus replaces the ""leaderboard"" view of websites with this far more useful ""unreads"" view.  That alone, if you ask me, is worth the price of admission.  But the abstraction applies to both reading and writing.  Gnus lets you post to websites in the same way you'd post to Usenet or ""post"" to an email thread.  Once a ""backend"" gets written for a message source (most likely http-based in the current REST landscape), Gnus deftly fills a slot for it amongst all your other ""subscriptions"" be they inboxes, mailing lists, RSS feeds, subreddits, Hacker News or Discourse forum topics.

The popular elfeed package runs circles around Gnus in search and retrieval speed, but elfeed is limited by the serial, unthreaded presentation of the RSS protocol.  Disparate stories and comments are interleaved in a time-ordered but largely incoherent queue.  Moreover, RSS doesn't let you respond, that is, elfeed can only provide a link to the original story in the browser.  In your Hulk-like rage to punish the flamebait, you might already have reverted to Bruce Banner by the time you've context switched to the browser.  On the other hand, being served an anemic HTML5 textbox to pen your immortal diatribe could reignite your gamma-ray fueled fury, so jumping back and forth between emacs and the browser isn't all bad.  My recommendation remains editing directly in emacs.

There's a greater, less obvious motivation at play though. **Gnus is a forcing function that makes you a better emacs user.**  Why do you struggle with emacs when vscode does everything correctly out of the box?  Because you're sanguinely aware that given enough time (but not as much time as vim or vscode would require), you can bend emacs to do anything including [brewing your coffee](https://youtu.be/y0LEW7a0LoQ).  And the more tasks you make it do, the cleaner and faster your elisp-fu becomes in making it do others.  Why not bring that powerful feedback loop to bear on that most essential of human activities, reading and writing messages from and to other people?",1585257597.0

I haven't found any useful or working chess implementations in elisp so far, that is only text based, so I was going to give it a go myself.

My goal is to create a function, obviously called ""chess"", that you can call and it's going to open a buffer or new frame with a textual representation of a chess board - so a little ascii art. You are then going to enter the move you want to make by providing the position of the figure you would like to move and the position you want to move it to like so:

    Figure to move: C1
    Field to move to: F4

Now this is obviously only going to let you play by yourself, but if I feel adventurous I'll implement a server/client or P2P architecture, that is going to allow two emacs clients to connect and play with each other, so you can play your friends or random people!

Tell me what y'all think of this idea, if you have any suggestions about the implementation or know any projects that are similair!

My assumption is that some common Mac OS framework used by terminal (and iTerm2) on Mac OS are intercepting these keypresses.  Graphical emacs likely sees the raw keycodes and interprets them distinctly.

This block shows what I mean:

Many people place the power of org-mode into the reports provided by org-agenda, which filters and summarizes org entries by tags, todo states, priorities and tags.

I don’t do that. My mind is simple. I like trees. Trees are easy. You have one org mode file and you filter it for what you need, whether it’s a quick glance at what you did last week or a peek at what you’re currently working on. 

This package provides an interactive filter window using the excellent org-ql library as well as the native calendar window to help with defining the scope of the filtering query.

StrangeAstronomer,Slight gripe about desktop-mode / recentf,0.88,False,False,6,fohhko,emacs,https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/fohhko/slight_gripe_about_desktopmode_recentf/,5,"I quite like desktop mode:

I also like to have recentf updated every time I visit a file (in case emacs doesn't exit cleanly)

Trouble is, they interact unpleasantly at startup. As desktop mode visits every file, recentf is saved and the minibuf gets the ""Wrote recentf"" message - it all seems to slow things down a lot apart from being ugly.

I tried adding the recentf hook after invoking desktop-save-mode but it doesn't change the startup behaviour. I tried deferring the desktop restore by:

    (setq desktop-restore-eager nil) 

\- but that's even worse, kicking in just when I get in the zone.

Any ideas on how to reconcile these features? TIA",1585128067.0

When I call `(helm-find-files-1 ""~/.bashrc"")` manually, that DOES open it in the current window.

So instead of being perfect, I have to do the bookmark + find file process and then switch to last buffer to see the buffer I actually just opened. Very confusing. Any help or suggestions for things to try would be greatly appreciated! Thanks",1585124215.0

  It doesn't complete on columns and table names though;

- sql-postgres - interactive SQL mode based on comint-mode. It's a bit better with company-tabnine, but still lacking.

- www.pgcli.com in vterm. pgcli is cool but it's an external app. If I really wanted an external app I could just use Postico. Also vterm has its own, annoying quirks.

This is desirable for me for both performance reasons (seeing poor performance with so many headlines) and to reduce clutter from search (for data in these particular files, I don't want them to be refiled to another file).

I prefer jumping to headlines via org-goto as opposed to using swiper because the search terms for a headline are also likely to be part of notes.

Similarly, it would be nice to have certain tags restricted to certain files. It's useful because you're then not overwhelmed with irrelevant tags when you're dealing with specific data that is only relevant in a particular file. Being presented with only tags that are relevant for that file encourages good tag usage.

in Clojure, e.g. it looks like (this is the result I want):

    (oklet (a 1
            b 2)
      body)

I a have problem with the indentation. The second line, with
`b 2)` is the problem. By default it gets indented to the
same column as the `1` above, like this:

    (oklet (a 1
              b 2)
      body)

I read
[here](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Indenting-Macros.html)
about the `(declare (indent ...))` form, but unless one is
using a special function it seems what I want can't be done.

So I figured this should exist already. `cl-indent.el`
seemed promising, but I can't get it to work. Here is the
documentation I'm using:
https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/emacs-lisp/cl-indent.el#L215
At the end of that comment (for
`common-lisp-indent-function`) it says that one can nest
lists, and a nested list controls how a list at that
position is indented. But as soon as I try to use a list it
complains. For example if I do `(function-put 'oklet
'common-lisp-indent-function '((2 2) 2 2))` then when I try
to indent it says

>lisp-indent-report-bad-format: oklet has
a badly-formed common-lisp-indent-function property: ((2 2)
2 2)

Looking at the examples further down in the file, it seems
all inner lists starts with `&whole`, but I can't figure out
how it works. For example, if I use

    (function-put 'oklet 'common-lisp-indent-function
                  '((&whole 6 &rest 0) &rest 0))

Then the indentation becomes:

    (oklet
          (a 1
             b 2)
    (some-call)
          (some-other-call))

OK so there the `(a 1` is indented by 6, but no matter what
I try I can't get the `b 2)` line to end up at another
position. And also, the second `&rest 0` makes the `(some-call)`
line have 0 indent, which makes sense, but shouldn't `&rest
0` make every following line also have indent 0, so what
about `(some-other-call)`, why does that have a 6 space
indent?

indentation rules in Emacs Lisp.",1584996051.0

Here's my next installment of ""GNU  Emacs as a lightweight IDE""  series for editing SQL. These enhancements to Semantic and sql-mode allows SQL code-completion for most common use-cases.

* Offline - Use DDLs in current file for auto-suggest
* Online - Use table information from DB for auto-suggest. DB connection is made using JDBC which allows connection to ANY DB in a platform independent manner. It also allows multiple simultaneous connections with easy switch-over.

Hope this will aid your productivity while using SQL in Emacs.

**Implementation notes:**

The SQL specific implementation is confined to three files - [sql.wy](https://gitlab.com/atamariya/emacs/-/blob/0cbbf9e29a2d915195336a3996be3703682b1c92/admin/grammars/sql.wy), [sql.el](https://gitlab.com/atamariya/emacs/-/blob/0cbbf9e29a2d915195336a3996be3703682b1c92/lisp/cedet/semantic/sql.el) and [company-semantic.el](https://gitlab.com/atamariya/emacs/-/blob/0cbbf9e29a2d915195336a3996be3703682b1c92/lisp/cedet/company-semantic.el). Most of the heavy lifting is done by the semantic and company framework.

\- sql.wy - This is the language grammar file. You compile this (run make in emacs/lisp directory)  to generate language parser sql-tags-wy.el.

\- semantic/sql.el - Overrides some semantic functions

\- company-semantic.el - Deals with auto-completion using semantic

\- progmodes/sql.el - JDBC product definition and supporting functions

\- H2 web console supports ""@tables"" meta commands. My customization makes them available to CLI console as well. (**Edit:** This is now merged in H2 via [https://github.com/h2database/h2database/pull/2527](https://github.com/h2database/h2database/pull/2527) .)",1584901938.0

The difficulty with emacs are modifier keys, because they aren't conveniently located a traditional keyboard. On my thinkpad the mouse keys are located in suitable position to be the ideal replacement. My current solution doesnt work that well, though you can try it for yourself. I have tried to turn the mouse keys into modifier keys, by remapping them.

The modifier only remains active for a single key event for example. It must be repressed if you want to go back multiple multiple words. Additionally though sometimes if this happens too rapidly it gets interpreted as mouse-event after as part of the key command.

Releasing the mouse can also trigger events which can cause the point to snap back to its original location before the mouse the location under the point can be edited. Binding it to the control, escape, or alt key doesnt seem to work either though it could be a fault of my own.

I'm a C++ programmer, and the lack of nice linux IDEs has been bothering me for years. I'd heard of Vim and emacs, but I was always a bit skeptical. I'd tried emacs before but hadn't been able to configure the packages I wanted and gave up. Now I tried again, and after some struggling managed to get a basic environment with RTags, projectile, company, flycheck, project-explorer, and clang-format going. It's improved my coding experience immensely, and I know as I get familiar with the tools it will become even better.

Even added my own customization to make compiling easier:

    (defun compile-from-root ()
      ""Call compile using projectile to set the root directory""
      (interactive)
      (setq default-directory (projectile-project-root))
      (call-interactively #'compile)

    (global-set-key (kbd ""C-c m"") 'compile-from-root)

With this I can hit compile from any file in a project and it will run it from the project root (where my makefile is) instead of from the current directory. And since it remembers the last command, recompile is just C-c m RET. So yeah, I like that I can streamline my workflow if I find myself annoyed by something.

However, there are just too many options and it bothers me that I'm not making the most of the tools I have. RTags offers a lot of possibilities for moving around, but I just can't recall what all the commands and shortcuts are. Same with the other packages and even just the base editor. I have a cheat sheet for the editor, and it helps, but switching over to it is a pain, and I need the documentation open for the packages too.

What I'd like, is an extension that keeps a thin vertical window with the commands available for each major or minor mode and updates as you switch buffers. Maybe showing just top commands for each, and the ability to scroll through them, and the keyboard shortcuts. Sort of training wheels while I learn and internalize everything that the tools can do for me.

I just started this little project of mine, and I thought maybe you guys might be interested.   

https://github.com/gsforza/emacs-the-adhd-way  

To quote my `README.md`:   
# Learn Emacs the ADHD way  
As a long-time vim user I always fantasized about having one place to do all my usual computing, note taking, email and task management. So naturally I have always been intrigued by Emacs and its capabilities: Org, the possibility of configuring my editor with an actual - and sane - (programming) language - opposed to the abomination that is `Vim script` - the community, the trillions of packages, just to name a few.  

The things that always held me back were the completely different key bindings, the necessity of learning Lisp at some point and the time of not being productive while learning and researching all of the aforementioned things, but the biggest concern - the new keybinding - got completely blown off when I learned about `evil-mode`, which is kind of an emulation layer, giving one the possibility to use vim keybindings inside Emacs.  

This made the transition from Vim to Emacs a lot less daunting to me. I could just use Emacs, kind of, like the way I used Vim and could learn and customize Emacs along the way. 'Perfect', I thought to myself, 'so now there is actually nothing holding me back anymore!' Well, there **was** nothing, except **my ADHD kicking in**.  

I spent countless days reading about a million things I thought of being super nice having in my config. I over-engineered the smallest things, browsed through `init.el` after `init.el` on GitHub and always found a new package I wanted to try. Suffice to say, I never really got stuff done, being too busy configuring Emacs and planning how to be more productive with **this** package and supposedly making my workflow easier with **that** package - without ever really learning Emacs.  

So I had to come up with something, as always, to contain my ADHD - this is the case especially when trying to learn something new and shiny. After countless hours evaluating **this** idea and **that** procedure (you see the pattern here, right?), in the end I came up with the idea of starting this project - **Learn Emacs the ADHD way** - which is just a collection of rules I will lay onto myself to truly learn Emacs. Plus, me publicizing this hopefully makes me go through with this, regarding my never-ending love for attention.  

## The constraints  
* I will force myself to go step-by-step, loosely following the Emacs documentation  
* At first I will install no* other package and evaluate every built-in functionality if it is enough for my use-case  
* I will not configure any other part of Emacs, may it be cosmetically or functionally  
* I will only research a part of Emacs when it is genuinely relevant to my workflow or when I am veritably encountering a problem or use case where the builtin feature is limiting me  
* I will time-constrain myself while researching and configuring; see below  

### Using the Pomodoro technique  
To hinder me of getting carried away - like so often - I will follow a strict rule: When I am researching something about Emacs, or some package I want to install, I will use the [Pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) to monitor myself.  

After finishing four ""pomodoros"" I will stop searching and use the best solution I have found up until the very moment the timer ends. If I still have the urge to look up **that one tiny last thing** (of course) I can do so in one of the breaks, but apart from that I will just go on with my life.  

## The goal  
Other than learning Emacs, I hope to learn coping with my ADHD and possibly encourage others - with or without the condition - to try this way of gradual and controlled learning. And, of course, I am hoping to spur some kind of discussion about learning, working and living with ADHD and all its aspects.

With posting here I hope to get some attention for the project and also get some guidance regarding the next steps of my adventure learning Emacs from the inside-out! Please feel free to file issues inside the repository, comment here or PM me. I am planning to keep posting updates here to let you take part in this journey.

I hope this question is not too trivial, but I spent hours on duckduckgo and google without finding any solution.

I'm pretty new to programming and I thought I'd like to learn python. Because i usually use emacs as my LaTeX editor I thought I'd give it a try to be my python editor too, so I installed elpy.

As I found out it is pretty common and useful to use virtual environments when programming with python, so I tried to set one up and it seemed as if it worked. At least in the bash I can easily switch into the virtual environment.

Also using M-x pyvenv-activate seems to work without a problem (as I can see the virtual environment in elpy-config). However when I use C-c C-c, the python shell that opens does not show any virtual environments.

Does anyone have any idea what I did wrong here?

I've previously used emacs-plus from homebrew with --HEAD. My motivation for switching is to use the more stable emacs 27 release.

I'm starting to think there are no downsides to changing those particular syntax classes (I've been doing that for months with no trouble at all), but maybe I'm wrong. Here is the text of the question, in case you don't want to follow the link:

It bothered me that sexp navigation commands didn't treat a quoted string as a single expression in text-mode. This is because the quote character `""` is in the punctuation syntax class in the text-mode syntax table. I decided to make it a string delimiter:

    (modify-syntax-entry ?\"" ""\"""" text-mode-syntax-table)

Similarly, I wanted sexp navigation commands in AUCTeX buffers to treat the initial backslash in a macro as part of the macro (as happens in the built-in latex-mode), so I changed the class of `\` to expression prefix:

    (modify-syntax-entry ?\\ ""'"" LaTeX-mode-syntax-table)

Now, I've been told that modifying syntax tables is ""dangerous"" and can have ""far-reaching unintended consequences"", but I've been using those for months and so far I haven't noticed any consequences other than _improved_ sexp navigation.

So my question is: what can actually go wrong? A good answer would be a specific example of some text and some commands that have different outcomes with and without the syntax class change, where the outcome with the change is clearly inferior in some way. Is there any actual danger or is this just an abstract fear some people have?",1584586608.0

I have a bunch of notes in plain texts. Most of them are my fleeting notes, diaries, or some study notes. Often as time passed, I find it hard to retrieve them back quickly, even though I remember the context and some keywords pretty well.

Protesilaos released a wonderful video on [ivy,fzf, and ripgrep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDkx48JwDco), showing how he (used to) find and locate a file quickly (fuzzily and incrementally). To get a quick idea of the level of convenience, either watch his video or see lots of GIFs in this [post](https://medium.com/@sidneyliebrand/how-fzf-and-ripgrep-improved-my-workflow-61c7ca212861). With that demonstration, I'm convinced that one can come up with a good workflow on searching plain texts.

The problem lies in the nature of `grep` and its relatives. They only search line by line. In my notes, each line does not contain more than 72 characters. While this helps a lot on readability, it definitely makes it harder to mine. I am curious of you methods within emacs. If you have some other thoughts, please also let me know.

I usually work with vanilla emacs and hardly use extensions, because I am afraid of getting too comfy with them, because I have to work across different OS'es and I do not have permissions to install packages especially through internet. 

I really love emacs, and want my juniors and students from less privileged communities to use emacs. I come from southern part of India. I have been working for last 7 years and my experience so far informs me of the choices I can make with the softwares I can choose to invest time because most of the students do not have access to a computer all time.

There are too many things to get familiar with for getting a job that can lead to a good career. Basic CS knowledge including couple of programming languages usually it is C/C++, Java and the FSF community also helps teach languages like python. Then data structures and system design. Along with all these principle-oriented knowledge we also have to gain skillsets-oriented knowledge of how to use usually Linux and windows systems and IDE for programming (our college still use turbo c) 

I want to if I may, evangelise emacs usage in our regional communities. I need take care and make responsible choices before I can ask my students to invest time in emacs. This question mostly revolves around what key bindings to use in emacs, because it is one of the things I see students hardly switch. I want to build a minimal configuration that I can provide to students to help them build good starting point. 

I have been looking at xah-fly-keys, evil-mode, boon and etc. I am also not very familiar with elisp programming. So I am unable to evaluate these choices. Spacemacs looks too big and slow at times like searching. I haven't tried doom emacs but I heard that it is faster.

- minimal configuration
- ergonomic key bindings like xah layout (that may be conducive  to vim based key bindings in case if someone lands on a job where he might be supposed to use vim)
- key bindings should be consistent across modes like gnus and org-mode

**Background Story**

You can skip this section if you don't want to learn *why* I am posing the question.

My company is using Confluence. Creating content within Confluence is tedious. I tend to author new text within Org mode and use `org-mode/contrib/lisp/ox-confluence.el` to export a region to Confluence markup language via `org-confluence-export-as-confluence`. This snippet can be imported to Confluence via ""+"" (Insert more content) and ""Markup"" with ""Confluence wiki"" syntax (instead of markdown that has some draw-backs here).

The thing is, that I'm using [radio targets](https://orgmode.org/manual/Radio-Targets.html) to realize a personal glossary and I do like it a lot. Whenever there is a definition of `- <<<foo bar>>> this is this and that` any occurrence of ""foo bar"" is a link to its definition within the same buffer. So far, so great.

When I export to Confluence, all these occurrences are broken links in Confluence markup `[foo bar|foo bar]` pointing to a page (mostly) yet to be created. I need to get rid of them before I copy&paste the content to Confluence.

Since `org-confluence-export-as-confluence` does not offer an option that does that:

**Naïve Approach: Search & Replace**

One possible approach is to write an elisp function that does search/replace. In order to not harm valid links, search and replace has to locate only links whose anchor text is identical to the link.

However, they do not necessarily result in identical strings because line breaks might appear.

So I would need to replace:

* `[foo bar|foo bar]` to `foo bar` (easy via `replace-regexp`)
* `[foo\nbar|foo bar]` to `foo bar` (how to deal with the opitonal line break?)

[https://github.com/dustinlacewell/deflayer.el](https://github.com/dustinlacewell/deflayer.el)

From the README:

Imagine you have some package that makes you configure where some data is.

Well, what if you wanted to use that package with two or more different sets of data?

This package will let you define the different configuration for each and switch between them easily.

## How?

Let’s use [Org-brain](https://github.com/Kungsgeten/org-brain) as an example.

Org-brain requires you to specify where the org-mode files making up your brain are located with the org-brain-pathsetting defined in the org-braindefcustom group.

Let’s specify the location of two!

Simply (require 'deflayer) and use the (deflayer) macro for each:

    (deflayer brain-one org-brain   
      ((org-brain-path ""~/org/brain-one/"")   
       (whatever-other-settings ""value one"")))  
    
    (deflayer brain-two org-brain   
      ((org-brain-path ""~/org/brain-two/"")   
       (whatever-other-settings ""value two"")))

We call (deflayer NAME GROUP BODY) twice. Once with settings for our first dataset, and once with settings for the second dataset.

This will save the values of all variables in the org-brain defcustom group to a defaults cache.

It will also produce two functions, deflayer-activate-brain-one, and deflayer-activate-brain-two.

Calling these functions will apply their respective configuration values specified in BODY.

At anytime call (deflayer-restore GROUP) with any defcustom group to reset all configuration values to their defaults.",1584291305.0

Based on the below logs, I checked the java process had started and jdtls server had received the start debug request, but I suspect that the attach thing is not working properly. 

Any idea about this is appreciating.

However, if you add a link from A to B then obviously B is also related to A, so the user should see the connection without adding manually a link from B to A.

This is what this package does. First you need to run M-x org-backlink-mode-refresh-cache which scans your org files (your agenda files by default) for links.

Then you can turn on org-backlink-mode minor mode in an org buffer which automatically shows backlinks to the current entry.

Here's a screenshot using the Org Manual as an example: https://i.imgur.com/t4Vh5at.png

If you don't want to see a message if the entry has no backlinks then set org-backlink-mode-show-no-backlink-message to nil.

I am using Ubuntu 19.10 and in my emacs I cannot use find-tags function because the /usr/share/emacs/26.3/lisp/TAGS is missing. Can I build it somehow? Every time I use emacs find-tags function I am asked to specify the position of the TAGS file. I would like to be able to search for the function definition by pressing META-. but right now I am not able to do that.

Thank you for your help.

SOLVED:

For Ubuntu emacs-el package contains the sources but they are compressed.

According to the manual etags works also with compressed files.

[https://linux.die.net/man/1/etags.emacs](https://linux.die.net/man/1/etags.emacs)

So I used this command to generate the file TAGS:

etags -a \*\*/\*.el.gz

This command should be executed in your emacs sources directory.

Mine is /usr/share/emacs/26.3/lisp because right now my emacs version is 26.3.

After this, if you put the cursor on the function name and press Meta-. you will be able to read the function code.

If you cannot install emacs source code you can clone it from the emacs git repository. Thank you u/github-alphapapa for the suggestion.",1584195037.0

YannZed,[Solution] Performance problem with Magit on MacOS,0.96,False,False,31,fhr72q,emacs,https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/fhr72q/solution_performance_problem_with_magit_on_macos/,25,"In my [previous post](https://old.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/ffwxc9/performance_problem_with_magit_on_macos/?ref=share&ref_source=link) I reported a performance problem with Magit on MacOS Catalina, where any action would be approximately 20x slower. I seem to have found a solution to that though, even though I still don't know what the cause is.

I was messing around with it some more, and checked the git executable with `magit-debug-git-executable`. It said that `magit-git-executable` was set to `git`, which is the default, and was pointing to the executable `/usr/local/bin/git`.

I just changed `magit-git-executable` to point to `/usr/local/bin/git` directly, and that fixed the issue completely. Now refreshing in Magit is only 2x slower than Linux, which is comparable with the `git` command speed from the terminal.

I hope this helps some other people that had a similar speed with Magit on MacOS. I have also added a comment on the [performance thread](https://github.com/magit/magit/issues/2982#issuecomment-598493683) on Github.

I want to create a new html export back-end for Org-Mode and it will have the option to export code blocks with line highlighting.

Is it possible to create a new property like `#+HEADER` for code blocks, for example:

    #+HIGHLIGHT: 1,5-10,12
    #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    ...
    #+END_SRC

If I use the `#+HEADER`, how can I extract parameters from it in this example? The header is a string, how can I parse it?


    #+HEADER: :highlight 1,5-10,12 :fetch api.github.com :title ""This is a Title""
    #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    ...
    #+END_SRC


I have already tried with, but these are global variables.

Here's a little experimental package which automatically shows the matching paren regardless of where you are in the line if the line ends with mulitple parens and the cursor is not after a paren (so it doesn't interfere with your existing paren package).

Here's a gif:  https://i.imgur.com/apWwBoU.gif

The code is really simple, you can start/stop the automatic paren display with the relevant commands.

This variant shows the matching part in the echo area if the other end is out of the screen: https://gist.github.com/codecoll/c861390a518556211388f87914db5023

many buffer groups as you need, add the buffers you want to it and
quickly navigate between :

- Buffers of the same group
- Buffer groups
- Workspaces, ie sets of buffer groups

Note that :

- A Location is a pair `(filename . position)`
- A buffer group, in fact a location group, is called a Circle
- A list of buffer groups is called a Torus (a Circle of Circles)
- The list of Toruses is called the Wheel

# Important note for version 1 users

Version 1 works well, so if you’re happy with it, it’s fine.

For those who want to switch to version 2, please note that the format
of torus files has changed, so it is recommended to backup your version
1 torus files, just in case something would go wrong with the conversion.

# New features

- Tab bar
	- More customizable
	- Can adapt to window size
- Move or copy circle to torus
- Roll circle, torus or the wheel

# Installation

## With [Straight.el](https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el)

Simply add these lines in your init file :

```
;; To improve your experience
(straight-use-package 'which-key)
(straight-use-package 'helm)
;; Necessary
(straight-use-package '(duo :type git :host github :repo ""chimay/duo""))
(straight-use-package '(torus :type git :host github :branch ""version-2"" :repo ""chimay/torus""))
```

# Configuration

## Minimal

```
;; Recommended
(use-package which-key
  :init (which-key-mode)
  :custom ((which-key-idle-delay 1.0)))
(use-package helm
  :config (helm-mode 1))
;; Necessary
(use-package duo
  :config
  (duo-init ""duo-common"" ""duo-referen""))
(use-package torus
  :after (duo)
  :config
  (torus-init)
  (torus-install-default-bindings))
```

## Advanced

If you want the start & quit hooks to load & save your torus file, you
need to add a `:hook` section. This declaration gathers main options
and keybindings :

```
(use-package duo
  :config
  (duo-init ""duo-common"" ""duo-referen""))

(use-package torus
  :after (duo)

Concerning the input method, the keybind doesn't work and if I try to change it with `M-x toggle-input-method` it appears in the mode line that I can write cyrillic but passes the usual latin letters to the browser.

This behaviour happens only in a EXWM buffer, as when I have an usual buffer I can type everything as expected.

Is there a configuration that I'm missing? Or maybe is necessary to make a workaround to the problem (something like opening an input buffer and after typing everything there, it will pass it to the EXWM buffer, similar of how `org-capture` works).",1583941122.0

I do apologise if I sound like I don't know what I am talking about. I am a (real) beginner to Emacs, and I am looking into running emacs from the terminal. Why would I be doing such a thing? Well, I am running Emacs from a remote server and ssh'ing into it from a tablet.

My question is, is it possible to get an Intellisense-style thing working within this mode for languages like Java, JavaScript, Python and C#.

Ideally, I would have the following things working:

* Intellisense
* Static Code Quality Check
* Testing
* Debugging
* Anything else you could come up with is welcome

I have full access to my VPS, so anything can be installed on it.

If you have a suggestion for a better way of doing this, I am always open for that to.

Thanks in advanced.

I am aware of the fact that there is an emacs application for Android. I am also aware I can run busybox and termux together to install emacs.

I looked into the [""org-ctags.el"" definition](https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/a98c8f5a098cf646c282be67cce9fb7999d353d7/lisp/org/org-ctags.el#L469) and copied and pasted the relevant lines into scratch and tested it, it seems that the placement of the `*` char is giving me the issue. Specifically, if I run this command in my terminal:


    ctags --langdef=orgmode --langmap=orgmode:.org --regex-orgmode=""/<<([^>]+)>>/\1/d,definition/"" -f /path/to/org/TAGS -e -R ""/path/to/org/*""


I got this error from ctags:


    ctags: Warning: cannot open input file ""/path/to/org/*"" : No such file or directory


If I instead put the `*` outside double quote:


    ctags --langdef=orgmode --langmap=orgmode:.org --regex-orgmode=""/<<([^>]+)>>/\1/d,definition/"" -f /path/to/org/TAGS -e -R ""/path/to/org/""*


It runs successfully.
So this implies that the elisp function in the above link should be changed to:


    (shell-command
        (format (concat ""%s --langdef=orgmode --langmap=orgmode:.org ""
	    	    ""--regex-orgmode=\""%s\"" -f \""%s\"" -e -R \""%s\""*"")

	        (expand-file-name (concat dir-name ""/TAGS""))
	        (expand-file-name (concat dir-name ""/"")))))


I'm not entirely sure it is my shell or what, I tried both bash and sh and both behaved like that. I also pasted that shell command to shellcheck which didn't report any issue regarding the placement of the wild card char `*` inside or outside double quotes. 
So, is this a bug of ""org-ctags""?

I'm trying to create a back-end for Org-Mode that exports to HTML and uses Tailwind.css for layout, colors and customization and Prism.js for syntax highlighting.

One of the features of Prism.js is that you can highlight lines if you pass it an attribute `data-line=""1,5,6-9""`. I'm thinking of using something like:

```org
#+HEADER: :highlight ""1,5,6-9""
#+BEGIN_SRC rust
fn main() {
    hello_world();
}
#+END_SRC

or

```org
#+BEGIN_SRC rust :highlight ""1,5,6-9""
fn main() {
    hello_world();
}
#+END_SRC

How can I get this property when exporting?

YannZed,Performance problem with Magit on MacOS,0.95,False,1584061078.0,42,ffwxc9,emacs,https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/ffwxc9/performance_problem_with_magit_on_macos/,35,"I have recently switched to MacOS from Linux and have had a few performance problems. First I had a problem with buffer editing being quite slow on large files, however, this was fixed by building a MacOS specific version of emacs with the Cocoa framework enabled, which I don't think I had before. However, now I am having problems with Magit as it seems to be very slow even on the smallest repository. Everything else seems to be working fine at the moment.

I seem to be having a performance issue with Magit on MacOS Catalina, it takes 0.6s to refresh a repository with one commit vs 0.033s on linux with the same repository. This increases to 1s on the main repository I work on and it therefore takes a while to perform any actions such as adding, removing files or committing.

I have read [Magit's guide on performance for MacOS](https://magit.vc/manual/magit/MacOS-Performance.html#MacOS-Performance), and have tried various versions of emacs from 26.3 to master (28.0.50). I have also tried to find posts about the same issue, and have tried their solutions but they have not worked either (such as turning off themes). Most recommended upgrading the emacs version from 26.1 which I already had done though. This issue persists if I launch emacs only with magit enabled and in the config file. In addition I have also tried the emacs-mac port, which does not seem to make a difference either.

I believe that it has something to do with git taking a long time to launch from emacs, which sounds similar to the `fork` vs `vfork` issue from emacs 26.1. I am not sure though how to check if my emacs version is actually calling `vfork` correctly.

Is there anything else I should try to debug? For now I only notice this problem in magit and it also seems to happen when only magit is enabled in the config file.

From the commandline, git executes as quickly as on linux. Two magit versions below:

    Magit 20200307.319, Git 2.25.1, Emacs 26.3, gnu/linux
    Magit 20200307.319, Git 2.25.1, Emacs 28.0.50, darwin

For comparison, here is the output for linux and mac after running `magit-refresh` on both linux and mac (on a repository with one file and one commit):

EbenHuxley,Unicode input from keyboard (QMK) to Emacs,0.79,False,1583681930.0,5,ffe2zt,emacs,https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/ffe2zt/unicode_input_from_keyboard_qmk_to_emacs/,5,"Hi there, I have setup my `QMK`-enabled keyboard to output Unicode characters. In short, that was adding `UNICODE_ENABLE = yes` line to the `rules.mk` file and adding the following two lines to the `config.h` file.
```
#define UNICODE_SELECTED_MODES UC_LNX, UC_OSX, UC_WIN, UC_WINC
#define UNICODE_CYCLE_PERSIST false
```
And afterwards adding (for example) `UC(0x2227)` and `UC(0x2228)` to `keymap.c` file in order to be able to type ""∧"" and ""∨"" characters. Now, this works fine in most GUI applications like web browsers, etc, it also works in Terminal (GUI). However in Emacs instead of ""∧"" and ""∨"" I get 2227 or 2228 "" "" (space) characters inserted in a buffer :(
 
 I have tried setting `(set-keyboard-coding-system 'utf-8)` without any effect.
 
 Switching to other Unicode insertion modes from my default `UC_LNX`, which gives the above behavior, results in:
  * for `UC_OSX`: same as pressing-and-holding Ctrl key and hitting digits (2227);
  * for `UC_WIN`: same as above with extra screen ""blink"";
  * for `UC_WINC`: only string `u2227` gets directly inserted in the buffer.
 
The behavior for `UC_LNX` seems to be explained by Emacs interpreting the unicode insertion as the following key-sequence: `Ctrl+2` + `Ctrl+2` + `Ctrl+2` + `Ctrl+2` + `Ctrl+7` + `[spacebar]`, thus inserting 2227 space characters... :/

I am using GUI version of GNU Emacs running on CentOS 7 with GNOME Shell 3.28.3.

This is the code that I came up with, it is rather simple if you [look at the code](https://old.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/fe42et/is_writing_an_emacs_menu_super_verbose_or_am_i/fjni25j/), which it should replace:

    (defmacro gen-mooo-game-menu (entry-list)
      (let (menu-entries)
        (dolist (item entry-list menu-entries)
          (push 
           `(define-key menu [,(intern (concat ""mooo-set-game-"" (symbol-name item)) nil)]
              (list 'menu-item ,(capitalize (symbol-name item))
                    (lambda ()
                      (interactive)
                      (setq mooo-game-theme ',item))
                    :button) '(:radio . (eq mooo-game-theme ',item)))
           menu-entries))))
    
    (defvar mooo-game-theme-menu
      `(let ((menu (make-sparse-keymap ""Game Theme2"")))
        ,@(gen-mooo-game-menu (hard medium easy))
        menu)
      ""Map for mooo game theme menu."")
    

[Look here to see](https://old.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/fe42et/is_writing_an_emacs_menu_super_verbose_or_am_i/fjni25j/), what it should generate.      
But it is not working as expected. I fear I made some fundamental error.         
*Question 1*: Could someone please give some explanation together with a solution?


*A second question*: is `(intern (concat ""mooo-set-game-"" (symbol-name item)) nil)` a good method to generate a symbol from a concatenated string?

*Note*: I do this solely for the sake of exercise.",1583643818.0

I am new to emacs and I want to add a custom-function to which-func-functions in order to show function name for a custom log.

I want emacs to show the 'stage1' string as function-name in the mode-line when I am in the 'Some more stuff' region. The custom function is as follows.

    (defun get-stage ()

I have a beefy workstation that addresses all these concerns, but the laptop I've been issued is a Macbook, so I've been evaluating systems for using Emacs to work on this codebase remotely from my laptop.

I've been at this for months (since May 2019), and my current setup is to use iterm2 to mosh into my GNU/Linux machine, attach to a tmux session, and run Emacs in the terminal.  There are three challenges with this setup:

1. Functions like find-file-at-point (with URLs) and browse-at-remote don't dispatch to the browser on my Macbook, but rather...do nothing.  I don't know how to address this.  This is a daily annoyance that I'd like to address.
2. On GNU/Linux (all my systems at home), the killring is integrated beautifully with the X clipboard.  On my Macbook, I constantly have to switch to the mouse (and C-x 1 so my Emacs buffer occupies the full frame) so I can cut/paste between Emacs (in iterm2) and all my other apps.  This is immensely inferior to the experience locally.
3. iterm2 has a _crazy_ interaction with Mac OS key rebinding, such that my desire to use Command as Meta seems to be unobtainable.  I've tried half a dozen configurations to try and get Command to map to meta (via Mac OS keyboard settings, iterm2 keyboard settings, and Emacs key rebinding), but haven't been able to get a working configuration.  I readily admit I might just be dense here, so if you have a working configuration, let me know!

I can `M-x customize-group` and target the `ns` group to set Command as Meta in my Emacs on the Macbook.  That makes Emacs on the Macbook pretty ergonomic, but leaves the question of remote access: how would I connect that (graphical) instance to my GNU/Linux box?  I got the idea to try and leverage Tramp.  I heavily make use of Projectile (particular fuzzy file finding within a project) and Magit in my workflow.  Magit has some latency, but works well over Tramp, but when I invoke `counsel-projectile-find-file`, the whole process hangs.  I ran the Emacs profiler to see what was up, and all the time is being spent in `tramp-check-for-regexp`.  I'm not sure how to debug from there, but it may be a useful piece of information.

Maybe projectile particularly sucks (even though I love it to death...thanks u/bbatsov!), so I tried `fzf`, `ftf`, and `ffip` to see if they performed better, but every one has issues of some sort (either hangs or produces radically incorrect output for Tramp buffers).

I've also tried mounting the remote code directory via MacFUSE and SSHFS, but this also results in incredibly poor performance (unusable, IMHO), that impacts not only fuzzy file finding, but also basic operations like `git status`.  It somehow felt like a regression from Tramp, which mildly surprised me, but perhaps shouldn't have.

I thought I might try VNC, but I'm a little surprised that in my research so far, I haven't been able to find a good way to handle this.  My team uses VSCode (mostly), and it seems to mount remote projects via SSH with minimal overhead, but I'm not ready to give up on Emacs, so I thought I'd ask the community: have you faced a scenario like this and prevailed?

Quiet_Soil,Rust Configuration Suggestions,0.87,False,False,11,fe5poi,emacs,https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/fe5poi/rust_configuration_suggestions/,7,"I spend most of my time programming Rust, but I wasn't happy with my config and wanted to pare it down. This is essentially my config now:

    (require 'company)
    (require 'rust-mode)
    (require 'flycheck)
    (require 'flycheck-rust)
    (require 'lsp-mode)
    (require 'company-lsp)

    (setq lsp-rust-server 'rust-analyzer)

    (add-hook 'rust-mode-hook 'lsp)
    (add-hook 'rust-mode-hook 'company-mode)
    (add-hook 'flycheck-mode-hook 'flycheck-rust-setup)

This gives me completion with company and definitions with rust-analyzer through lsp which are my two main asks. However, I have two gripes at this point. The first is that lsp takes forever to load when I open a file in a fairly simple CRUD warp API. Granted, there are 273 packages, but this load time wasn't a problem with rustic mode. My second gripe is that completions with company-lsp take at least a second to pop up. I wouldn't mind this one so much but Racer provided completions much faster. 

I have a different config, but it uses RLS through Racer and rust-analyzer for everything else which I'm not a huge fan of. I'd rather just use rust-analyzer.

I'm looking for suggestions on how to improve these issues or alternative packages if there are others that provide a better experience. Also, links to emacs configs are welcome and appreciated. Thanks for any and all help!",1583486252.0
codesections,"Is writing an Emacs menu super verbose, or am I missing something?",0.81,False,1583595893.0,6,fe42et,emacs,https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/fe42et/is_writing_an_emacs_menu_super_verbose_or_am_i/,9,"I've never done much with menus in in Emacs/elisp (I don't use them personally, so haven't bothered writing them in the past).  I'm writing one for the first time now for a PR to mu4e, and can't tell if I'm missing something obvious or if they're surprisingly painful to write.

I'd like to let the user select one of five values for a variable.  To do that, I'm using Emacs' [extended menu items](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Extended-Menu-Items.html) and `:radio` buttons.

This works but, as far as I can tell, requires me to define a **separate** command for every value I'd like the user to be able to give the variable.  I'd end up with something like [this snippet from the bubbles game](https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/d0e2a341dd9a9a365fd311748df024ecb25b70ec/lisp/play/bubbles.el#L103-L131) where the code defines _six_ commands that are identical aside from one different symbol in each.  (Almost as bad: it results in six new interactive commands being added to the `M-x` menu for essentially no reason)

Is that really how we're supposed to build menus?  It's so unergonomic that it makes me wonder whether I'm either missing something obvious or fundamentally misunderstanding the way to approach writing menus in Emacs.

EDIT: as requested in the comments, here is a minimal working example of a menu allowing the user to set a variable to multiple values (a simplified version of [the bubbles code]((https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/d0e2a341dd9a9a365fd311748df024ecb25b70ec/lisp/play/bubbles.el#L103-L131) linked above):

    (defvar bubbles-game-theme-menu
      (let ((menu (make-sparse-keymap ""Game Theme"")))
        (define-key menu [bubbles-set-game-hard]
          (list 'menu-item ""Hard"" 'bubbles-set-game-hard
                :button '(:radio . (eq bubbles-game-theme 'hard))))
        (define-key menu [bubbles-set-game-medium]
          (list 'menu-item ""Medium"" 'bubbles-set-game-medium
                :button '(:radio . (eq bubbles-game-theme 'medium))))
        (define-key menu [bubbles-set-game-easy]
           (list 'menu-item ""Easy"" 'bubbles-set-game-easy
                :button '(:radio . (eq bubbles-game-theme 'easy))))
        menu)
      ""Map for bubbles game theme menu."")
    
    (defun bubbles-set-game-easy ()
      ""Set game theme to `easy'.""
      (interactive)
      (setq bubbles-game-theme 'easy)
      (bubbles))
    
    (defun bubbles-set-game-medium ()
      ""Set game theme to `medium'.""
      (interactive)
      (setq bubbles-game-theme 'medium)
      (bubbles))
    
    (defun bubbles-set-game-hard ()
      ""Set game theme to `hard'.""
      (interactive)
      (setq bubbles-game-theme 'hard)
      (bubbles))

The verbosity I'm talking about is the second half, where each menu item requires defining a separate command – even though each command is identical apart from calling `setq bubbles-game` with a different symbol.  The duplication is annoying in this abbreviated example, but gets much worse with menus that offer more than the three options shown here (the duplicated code obviously scales linearly with the number of options).

**EDIT**– solved, based on u/SlowValue's code below.  The code snipped above could be rewritten as:

    (defvar bubbles-game-theme-menu
      (let ((menu (make-sparse-keymap ""Game Theme"")))
        (define-key menu [bubbles-set-game-hard]
          `(menu-item ""Hard2 ,(lambda () (interactive) (setq bubbles-game-theme 'hard))

        (define-key menu [bubbles-set-game-medium]
          `(menu-item ""Medium"" ,(lambda () (interactive) (setq bubbles-game-theme 'medium))

                :button '(:radio . (eq bubbles-game-theme 'easy))))

This function works as expected. I have edited my post to clean up the function. Any feedback for alternative approaches is still welcome!

I have started adding a custom 'tags' field in my bibtex file so I can filter by topic. Now, I want to control the tags vocabulary, so I thought I can create a completing-read prompt populated with the list of existing tags, so each time I want to 'tag' a new bib-entry, I can choose from this list. I have put together some functions to first grab all lines containing ""tags"" from this file, then splitting the comma-separated entry, dropping duplicates, and finally present the completing-read prompt:

Pan4TheSwarm,Org-mode directory manipulation,1.0,False,False,11,fdykmm,emacs,https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/fdykmm/orgmode_directory_manipulation/,8,"I'm interest in a way to manipulate a directory structure from within an org document. Namely, given the following org document.

    **** paper.tex
    ** org
    *** notes.org
    ** pics
    *** vacation.jpg
    *** vid

Results in the following directory structure.

    │   │   └── main.c
    │   └── proj2
    │       └── prog.py

    └── pics
        ├── vacation.jpg
        └── vid
            └── vid.mp4

If I wanted to change that directory structure, I could do so easily using normal org editing.

For example, if I decided that I wanted a 'example/vid' directory instead of the 'example/pics/vid' directory, I could change the following snippet...

    ...
    ** pics
    *** vacation.jpg
    *** vid
    **** vid.mp4

And change it to...

    ...
    ** pics
    *** vacation.jpg
    ** vid
    *** vid.mp4

Which would result in the following directory structure

    ~/example
    ├── dev

I'm trying to customize the html export of my org-mode files.

The thing is, I'm using Prism.js to highlight code blocks and  I want to highlight lines in source code blocks. For this, I need to add an attribute to the `pre` class: `data-line=1,5,8-10`.

I'm thinking of using a new header in the source code block and then use that info to export it html, for example:

    #+BEGIN_SRC rust :highlight ""1,5,8-10""
    fn main() {
        let x = 5;
        x = 2; // cannot assign twice to immutable variable
    }
    #+END_SRC

Is it possible to customize headers in source code blocks? Is there an easier way to do this? 

Just to brag about my theme here is an image: [This is how it looks like](https://imgur.com/4Y03sdw). It was inspired by the theme in the rust The Book website.

Edit1: [Github Repo](https://github.com/vascoferreira25/org_mode_export_theme)

Edit2: I found an alternative that is to use `#+ATTR_*`, this way I can get the key from the block properties.

(`tailwind` is the name of my export back-end)

A function to get the attributes:

    (defun org-tailwind--get-attribute (attribute block)
      ""Get the ATTRIBUTE from an org BLOCK element.
    The ATTRIBUTE looks like this `#+ATTR_*'""
      (car (org-element-property attribute block)))


A custom src-block parser - notice the attributes in the `let*` block:

    (defun org-tailwind-command-line-block (src-block contents info)
      ""Transcode SRC-BLOCK with command line language to a custom Prism.js code block.""
      (let* ((code-text (org-element-property :value src-block))

I've recently started to read and send mail in Emacs (I'm using Doom Emacs) using offlineimap and mu4e. It works well so far but there is something I'm missing:

In my Gmail inbox, I have my main drawer that is called ""primary"" (everything that has not been classified for the ""social"", ""promotions"" or any other drawer). I use Gmail such that this drawer is kept tidy, that is as soon as I read an email and don't need it anymore I ""archive"" (press the archive button in Gmail) it (not delete). That means my inbox usually consists of only a few emails which I still have pending actions on or something but all the rest is archived.

I would like to translate this ""view"" into mu4e, but with my default setup, I simply see all emails.

Here is mu4e related config:

    ;; Use offlineimap as mu4e backend

I am trying to make an elisp function that will create all directories and files in a list.

E.g. given a list

`(setq list '(""/home/gino/directory/file1.txt"" ""/home/gino/directory2/""))`

the function should create directory/file1.txt and directory2/ ONLY and ONLY IF these don't exists already.

My current draft is

    (defun create-files-from-list (list)

 -

I recently switched over to Emacs for writing my personal journal. Emacs is absorbing everything text-related in my life, it seems.

The structure for my journals is pretty simply:

 - One text file per month. Example: `~/txt/journal-2020-03.org`
 - One top-level headline for each day. Example:: `* 2020-03-04 Wednesday`
 - One second-level headline for each post. Example: `** Thoughts on today's presentation`

I've gotten most of the way there on my own, thanks to the pretty decent docs. The relevant part of my config is as follows:

    (defun journal-path ()
      ""Like ~/txt/journal-2020-12.org""
      (concat org-directory (file-name-as-directory ""journal"")
        (format ""%s-%s.org"" ""journal"" (format-time-string ""%Y-%m""))))

    (setq org-capture-templates
     '(
       (""j"" ""Journal"" entry (file+olp+datetree journal-path)
        ""* %?\nEntered on %U\n  %i\n  %a"" :kill-buffer t :empty-lines 1)))

The only issue left remaining is that the structure includes a lot of redundant (for my purposes) headlines:

    * 2020
    ** 2020-03 March
    *** 2020-03-04 Wednesday
    **** Thoughts on today's presentation

I would prefer:

    * 2020-03-04 Wednesday
    ** Thoughts on today's presentation

I believe the answer is to use `file+function` and `format-time-string`, but I can't figure out how do the ""create the `2020-03-04 Wednesday` part if it doesn't exist, but only add a new subsection if it does"" part.

Any hints would be greatly appreciated! Thanks kindly",1583387707.0

>This package provides Electric Replace mode, a buffer-local minor mode that replaces inserted text according to a list of strings (matches) and their associated replacements on the fly.  
>  
>It is similar to [Abbrev mode](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Abbrevs.html) in that it replaces/expands text that was inserted into the buffer. It differs from Abbrev mode in that it tries to find matches more frequently. While Abbrev mode only looks at the previously typed word after a non-word-constituent character is encountered, Electric Replace mode looks at all the characters that were previously typed in one go without too long of an interruption.

I've put this into a gist for now (vs. a Github repo) b/c I'm unsure if ""electric replace"" is the best name for this package. Calling it ""electric"" seemed a good idea given that it magically updates buffer contents while typing. Then again, this is similar enough to Abbrev mode that ""something abbrev"" would make sense as well? Naming is hard :)

Basically it boils down to:

* Increasing `gc-cons-threashold` on startup and reseting it after startup
* Calling `gcmh` right after the above step
* Not calling `package-initialize`
* ""Manually"" creating the `load-path` (with a function that sweeps the `elpa` directory and add each folder name to the `load-path` automatically)
* Setting use-package to `always-defer` and `always-ensure`, and `demand`ing any package i'd liek to load rightaway.
* Using emacs 27 new feature `package-quickstart` to `t`
* Several other minor optimizations like setting `file-name-handler-alist` to `nil`, defering loading of some packages after idle time, and stuff like that.

So i was able to reduce startup time from like 6 to 8 seconds to 1 second, which is great.

But with that came some adjustments i had to make, like some packages not starting correctly without proper hooks and `:init` sections configured and other minor inconveniences.

But right now the biggest problem is that lsp doenst start because it complains with this error:
`There are no language servers supporting current mode go-mode registered with `lsp-mode'.`

I use `exec-path-from-shell` with `:demand t` and on calling `exec-path-from-shell-initialize` right after its loaded (on the `:init` section), and i can see the emacs `exec-path` has my paths from the system's `$PATH`.
I can also call the language servers from the terminal without issues, but emacs LSP fails to load because it cant find the,.

How could i solve this? What might i be doing wrong that is causing this issue?

Here are the changes in order of impact:

**New Features**

-   Default Tag values are now configurable. Categories already were and
    Tags now work the same way.
-   Subtree Entries are made with a template now.
-   Added `FUTURE.org` to store ideas and requests for functionality
    that could be implemented in the future rather than leave them as
    open issues.

**Corrections**

-   Automatic Image Uploading
    -   Now an Option, that is disabled by default. Normally a change
        that disables a feature would warrant a major version number
        change but not this time. The feature is for advanced users.
        Everyone else is likely to find the behavior confusing. Sorry
        for the hassle this imposes on current users.
    -   No longer uploads `A HREF` links. This behavior has prevented
        using relative blog links. In fact it prevented any kind of
        link.
    -   Greatly expanded documentation.
-   Load `subr-x`.
-   Remove \""Listing\"" prefix `ox-wp-src-block-shortcode` and
    `ox-wp-src-block-html`.
-   Correct listing format spacing in `ox-wp-src-block-shortcode` and
    `ox-wp-src-block-html`.
-   Accidentally completely disabled publishing so re-enabled it. No
    biggie `O_O`.

,Binder – modes for structuring a multi-file writing project,0.96,False,1583200694.0,61,fc8hc2,emacs,https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/fc8hc2/binder_modes_for_structuring_a_multifile_writing/,22,"Hello. Creator of [fountain-mode](https://github.com/rnkn/fountain-mode) and [olivetti](https://github.com/rnkn/olivetti) here. I've pushed version 0.1.0 of Binder: [https://github.com/rnkn/binder](https://github.com/rnkn/binder)

**Update:** I added a sample binder project to the repository to get started.

**Warning: this is alpha-level software. Although it does not touch files on disk, you should consider all binder data (project structure, notes, statuses) as susceptible to loss. Key bindings, variable and function names, and overall program design are subject to change.**

&#x200B;

[screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/kpqd4k8wn7k41.png?width=2566&format=png&auto=webp&s=385d5771e3bb6b74eebea6dd07112c04aa09dc78)

Binder is collection of interlinked modes to facilitate working on a writing project in multiple files. It is heavily inspired by the binder feature in the [macOS writing app Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/features?os=macOS).

The rationale behind working this way is to split a large writing project into much smaller pieces.

## Features

Primarily, Binder provides a global minor mode `binder-mode`. This allows working with files in the current binder data, which is saved in a `.binder.el` file in the current directory. (You can change the name of this file is `binder-default-file` option.)

At this top-level, the main interaction with your binder will be in navigating back and forth between binder files:

* `binder-next` (bound to `C-c ]`) visits the next file in the binder, and
* `binder-previous` (bound to `C-c [`) visits the previous.

Calling these commands activates a transient map so that each command can be repeated by repeating only the last key.

You probably want some idea of the structure of your binder project...

* `binder-reveal-in-sidebar` (bound to `C-c ;`) will find the current file in the binder sidebar (see blow) or call `binder-init-binder-file` if there is none.
* `binder-toggle-sidebar` (bound to `C-c '`) toggles the visibility of the binder sidebar.

And when you're writing and what to add something new, you can with...

* `binder-add-file` (bound to `C-c :`) prompts for a file-name and add this possibly non-existent file to the binder after the current file's index. If no file-name extension is provided, use value of the binder's `default-extension` property (set with `binder-default-file-extention` option).

## Binder Sidebar Mode

A major mode for displaying the binder sidebar. This is where your main interaction with the binder happens.

Binder items are displayed in a linear ordered list. Calling `binder-sidebar-find-file` (bound to `RET`) or `binder-sidebar-find-file-other-window` (bound to `o`) will visit the corresponding file.

Each item in the binder sidebar displays the following information:

1. `binder-sidebar-include-char` (default `x`) denotes that this item has a non-nil value for its `include` property and therefore is included in `binder-stable-mode` (see below).
2. `binder-sidebar-notes-char` (default `*`) denotes that this item has a string value for its `notes` property, which can be edited in `binder-notes-mode` (see below), or
3. `binder-sidebar-missing-char` (defautl `?`) denote that the item's corresponding file cannot be found, but can be relocated by calling `binder-sidebar-relocate` (bound to `R`).
4. The item name, either the `car` of the item element or its `display` property, which can be set by calling `binder-sidebar-rename` (bound to `r`).
5. The item `status` property value, prefixed with `binder-sidebar-status-char` (default `#`). The display of this value can be set with the `binder-sidebar-status-column` option.

Items can be reordered with `binder-sidebar-shift-up` (bound to `M-p` & `M-up`) and `binder-sidebar-shift-down` (bound to `M-n` & `M-down`).

Each item's include state is toggled with `binder-sidebar-toggle-include` (bound to `x`).

Each item can be given a status with `binder-sidebar-set-status` (bound to `#`). Filter item by including or excluding a status with `binder-sidebar-filter-in` (bound to `/`) and `binder-sidebar-filter-out` (bound to `\`). To clear a status, just set an empty string. (n.b. Each command filter in/out only a single status, therefore it won't make sense to use them in conjunction.)

The notes buffer (see below) can be accessed with either `binder-sidebar-open-notes` (bound to `z`) or `binder-sidebar-toggle-notes` (bound to `i`).

You can customize how the sidebar window is displayed by setting `binder-sidebar-display-alist` option.

(There is a ""mark"" functionality, but this is yet to be implemented beyond just temporarily making items look marked.)

## Binder Notes Mode

A major mode for editing binder notes.

Notes are only saved to the binder when calling `binder-notes-commit` (bound to `C-c C-c`). Calling `quit-window` (bound to C-c C-q) or `binder-toggle-sidebar` does not save notes.

By default, the notes window will update to the corresponding item notes whenever the cursor moves in the binder sidebar. This may be disconcerting, so you can change it by setting the `binder-notes-keep-in-sync` option.

If the notes side window feels too small, you can pop the buffer out to a regular sized window with `binder-notes-expand-window` (bound to `C-c C-l`).

You can customize how the notes window is displayed by setting `binder-notes-display-alist` option.

## Binder Staple Mode

A minor mode for ""stapling"" binder files together.

When calling `binder-sidebar-staple` (bound to `v`), items marked as included in the binder will be concatenated in a new buffer, separated by `binder-staple-separator` string.

In this buffer, calling `binder-staple-find-original-file` (bound to `M-RET`) will visit the original file corresponding to the text at point.

## Why not just use Org Mode?

Org Mode is nice, but it's also a very *heavy* tool that almost insists that everything be done within Org Mode. This isn't useful if you want to write in a different format, e.g. Markdown or Fountain.

Also, I prefer to keep my writing in a collection of separate text files. It feels nicer to work on something small and self-contained than to organize a large file with headings and use indirect buffers with narrowing.

## Requirements

* Emacs 25.3

I'm using lsp-mode and clangd together (along with company-lsp and lsp-ui). It generally works well, but recently I've run into an issue where the interface is very, very slow to react to my typing.

For example, if I type

    Eigen::VectorXd a = b * c + d;

I will see flycheck spit errors at me one-by-one, from ""`Eigen::Vec` does not name a type"" to ""no right hand side"" to ""missing semicolon"". It's as if emacs is sending every single letter I type one at a time to clangd and showing the response.

Here's a snippet of `lsp-print-performance` from when this is happening: https://gist.github.com/williewillus/70c780c0383ef5e23e3b7e8f01c1ba74 . During this part of the trace, I'm not typing anything, I'm just waiting for lsp/flycheck to catch up with the line I've already typed.

This was typed pretty quickly too -- is there a debounce interval that I can make emacs wait for before sending any queries to the LS? (about 0.5-1s would probably do for me). Alternatively, what's the root cause of this?

So i'm a vim user and a couple of days ago I decided that I wanted to try Emacs. So far everything looks amazing and im really considering to move completely.

However, im experiencing some confusions with the lsp-mode and company-mode...

Based on the tutorials so far I have seen, im using use-package in order to get my packages from MELPA.

My config for LSP and company is the following:

`(use-package company`  
	`:ensure t`  
	`:diminish """"`  
	`:init`  
	`:config`  
`(global-company-mode)`  
`(company-tng-configure-default)`  
	`(setq company-tooltip-limit 10)`  
`(setq company-dabbrev-downcase 0)`  
`(setq company-idle-delay 0)`  
`(setq company-echo-delay 0)`  
`(setq company-minimum-prefix-length 1)`  
`(setq company-require-match nil)`  
`(setq company-selection-wrap-around t)`  
`(setq company-tooltip-align-annotations t))`

`(use-package company-web`  
  `:ensure t`  
  `:config`  
  `(add-to-list 'company-backends 'company-web-html))`

`(use-package company-tern`  
 `:ensure t`  
 `:config`  
 `(add-to-list 'company-backends 'company-tern)`  
 `(add-hook 'js2-mode-hook (lambda ()`  
`(tern-mode)`  
`(commpany-mode))))`  
`(use-package all-the-icons-dired :ensure t)`  
`(use-package lsp-mode`  
 `:ensure t`  
  `:init (setq lsp-keymap-prefix ""s-l"")`  
  `:hook (;; replace XXX-mode with concrete major-mode(e. g. python-mode)`  
`(XXX-mode . lsp)`  
`;; if you want which-key integration`  
`(lsp-mode . lsp-enable-which-key-integration))`  
  `:commands lsp)`

`(use-package lsp-ui :ensure t :commands lsp-ui-mode)`

`(use-package company-lsp :ensure t :commands company-lsp)`

&#x200B;

Based on the above config, I can't get to work properly... Neither do I get a warning if I write wrong code, nor the autocompletion works with the proper backend... i only get general completion which is not optimal...

Is there some advice you can give me how to tackle this issue?

Do you happen to know any articles that explain company mode and it's configuration for web development or Javascript only, or even typescript only? I tried to find some but I had no luck.

Tried some youtube videos but most of theme they were very brief and I did not get anything.

Hello,

I use Emacs in a terminal and recently I noticed that my screen flickers when I'm scrolling through a big python file. If I split the screen vertically, it flickers less. If I disable `display-line-nimbers-mode` or set it to absolute, emacs doesn't flicker anymore. It starts flickering not immediately when I open the file, but I have to scroll for a few seconds before it begins. It doesn't happen with `emacs -Q` and enabled relative line numbers. It also doesn't happen with my configuration but disabled `font-lock-mode` And I think that it happens not in every python file, some of them don't flicker (especially without multiline strings, they don't flicker at all):

* `display-line-nimbers-mode` disabled: no flickering
* absolute line numbers: no flickering
* disabled `font-lock-mode`: no flickering
* `emacs -Q` and enabled relative line numbers: no flickering

I also use `highlight-indentation-mode` but disabling it doesn't fix flickering.

How else can I debug to find out what causes the problem? I tried to profile it, but it doesn't  use a lot of CPU and I don't see anything suspicious in the profiler results. I checked garbage collection messages and GC doesn't happen during flickering.

I also tried a few others terminal programs (I use kitty): iTerm2, Terminal, Alacritty and it happens everywhere. I tried to play with Kitty terminal [settings](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/conf.html#conf-kitty-performance): `repaint_delay`, `input_delay`\*\*,\*\* `sync_to_monitor` but they don't change the situation and I returned them back to defaults.

I see the same flickering in emacs 26.3. In GUI emacs it doesn't happen at all.

Sorry, the video is a bit too long, but at the end of the video I'm disabling `display-line-nimbers-mode` and it stops flickering. In the middle I'm also splitting the screen vertically and after switching forth and back between windows it flickers less. I'm not sure how it's related, but splitting definitely helps.

It doesn't depend on scrolling speed and it flickers even when I'm just moving cursor without scrolling:

*Why:*     

  - I encountered several inconveniences during using of smartparens. Which I try to solve by configuring smartparens, fixing the code or changing my habits. But everytime I do so, I encounter some other inconvenience.
  - initial load time of smartparens is rather heavy (lazy loading is no option because of my heavy usage, emacs-server is no option for several reasons)
  - source code is pretty complicated and reimplements much of emacs functionality (i.e `forward-sexp` is reimplemented by sp-forward-sexp`)


*what I like about smartparens:*

 - it is useful in *nearly every major-mode* (this is important for me)
 - navigating in-to, out-of, forwards and backwards: sexps, strings, brackets to virtually every position (standard emacs provides only half of that functionality)
 - splicing (including killing parts of sexp)
 - wraping marked text
 - slurping/barfing following/previous sexps
 - keeping brackets paired

I'm not sure if this relates to `lsp-mode`, Projectile, Intelephense or Doom Emacs specifically, but I am having a problem with multiple PHP projects.

When I open a PHP project (`SPC p a` to add or `SPC p p` to choose a known project root), `lsp-mode` kicks in and starts the Intelephense language server as expected.  If I run `lsp-describe-session` I see the project root together with a running `iph` process.  I can then delete the workspace (`SPC TAB d`) and I get a message telling me that the language server was terminated.  This is all fine of course.

The problem I'm getting however is when I then open a different PHP project.  It starts the language server for this new project, but then also starts one for the previously opened project.  `lsp-describe-session` now shows both project roots together with a running language server for each.  I only noticed this because I work on many PHP projects (although only one at a time) and after a while it was running 6 language servers meaning that each project was taking over a minute to open.

The only way I've found to solve this problem is, after opening a different project, to execute `lsp-workspace-folders-remove` and remove each of the other project root folders manually one by one.  But as soon as I open another project again (even after closing the previous one first) it gets added back in.

Specifically I believe that everything is getting added to a single `lsp-session-file` meaning that whenever `lsp-mode` is activated it spawns a language server for everything in that session unless I explicitly remove it.

I'm sure I'm doing something wrong, but I can't figure out what.  I would expect that when opening a PHP project only one language server for that specific project root would be spawned.  If I have two projects open, there are two language servers, but if I have one project open then there's only one.

I'm not sure yet if this only affects PHP projects or all types of projects under `lsp-mode`.

Is that normal behaviour, or is there something I can change to make it all align to the largest line number type thing?

Also I'm trying to improve my organisation of my notes file, and am adding/changing the way I do dates etc, I was wondering how possible it would be to swap dates for the document.

I was using `dd.mm.yyyy, dayoftheweek`, but now I want to use `yyyy.mm.dd, dayoftheweek.`

Can I use some clever regex or something to swap the yyyy and dd around?

ivy-20200211.1338   
swiper-20200122.1153   

____

Recently swiper has changed behaviour. 
It used to be that after searching for a term `C-s <term>`, if I wanted to search again for the same term I would just type `C-s` and the previous term would automatically be populated in the swiper buffer. 

I experimented with emacs 28 from git for a while and had to change a few things in my config key bindings. 

I returned back to emacs 26.3 and reverted my config back to the same state as before. I **did** update the packages however - in particular ivy/swiper and counsel are all at the version shown above.

For a short time I could recall the previous swiper search by repeating `C-s` twice after invoking `swiper` - which for my config means `C-s C-s C-s`. However that has also stopped working. 

I'm aware I can use `M-p` to go through the search term history but I'd much prefer `swiper` to work the way it did previously.

Has anyone had similar experience?   
Any ideas what's wrong or why it's changed?   
How can I fix this so that `swiper` automatically recalls the previous term the way it used to - or at least pressing `C-s` again recalls the previous search?

How do I fill column 2 and 4 with the correct morse code?
I am aware of the ""morse-region"" function, to call it I need to somehow copy the column 1 content over to column 2, mark it to a region, then call ""morse-region"".
I tried this formula:

    '(morse-region (org-table-get nil 1))

But it gave ""#ERROR"".

I also tried highlighting the letters in column 1 (I'm using Evil so to do that I typed ""C-v"", then move cursor to select a single column), then do ""M-x morse-region"". That converts all columns, not just the highlighted column 1 to morse.

So how could I achieve that? Thanks.",1582803391.0

I am using `transient.el` to make a menu with all things I can do; one of the 'prefix commands' takes as an argument a filename. I am using read-file-name to get a file. When I try to use that function however (or just read-file-name from the IELM repl), it allows me to select directories in the helm completion buffer (I'm using helm). So basically if I do:


```
ELISP> (read-file-name ""x: "")

I see the helm completion buffer, but if I select (by hitting enter) a directory (which normally would cause me to see the directory contents and possibly select a file there) instead I wind up getting the directory as the return value.


```
ELISP> (read-file-name ""x: "")

""/the/directory/""

This is not what I want, I want to see the directory contents when I select it so I can choose a file in there.

I am using emacs 26.1, vanilla with some customization, not a lot. I don't understand what the difference is here between this and `find-file` for example, which doesn't allow me to select directories, even though it uses read-file-name under the covers.

I am new to Emacs (I am using spacemacs), and this is my first post. Please be patient. I am still learning but now that I realize the power of Emacs I want and hope to learn elisp also.

I have a bunch of org files prefixed 01-17. Each file is an individual publication. On each file I included a snippet of elisp code (borrowed from the [dft-book]) which looks like this one:

    (load-file ""dft.el"")

    ; This allows to selectively ignores headlines
    ; See: https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/55241/how-to-avoid-export-org-mode-header-title

            '(:with-author t
              :with-date t
              :with-title t
              :with-timestamps t
              :with-todo-keywords t
              :with-toc nil))

    (shell-command (format ""pdflatex -shell-escape -interaction=batchmode %s"" inputfilename))
    (shell-command (format ""bibtex %s"" inputfilename))
    (shell-command (format ""makeindex %s"" inputfilename))
    (shell-command (format ""pdflatex -shell-escape -interaction=batchmode %s"" inputfilename))
    (shell-command (format ""pdflatex -shell-escape -interaction=batchmode %s"" inputfilename))
    ; delete some files
    (mapcar (lambda (ext)
            (let ((filename (concat (format ""%s"" inputfilename) ext)))
              (when (file-exists-p filename) (delete-file filename))))
          '("".sol"" ""_xdefs.cut"" "".aux"" "".ind"" "".ilg"" "".idx""
            "".bbl"" "".qsl"" "".out"" "".log"" "".blg""))

    (mapcar (lambda (x)
            (when (file-exists-p x) (delete-file x)))
          '(""exerquiz.djs"" ""dljslib.ljs"" ""dljslib.djs"" ""texput.log"" "".tex""))

    (save-buffer)
    (princ (format ""BUILT ON %s"" (current-time-string)))

When I hit `C-c C-c` on that block I get the pdf document generated, so it works great!

Now I would like to go a step further.

With the idea of latexmk in mind, I thought it would be nice to have latex to compile the document on every change of the org file. I made a research and apparently [it is possible] according to u/larstvei.

I have adapted the snippet to my needs by including this at the end of the file:

    # Local Variables:
    # eval: (server-start)
    # eval: (add-hook 'after-save-hook 'org-latex-export-to-latex nil t)
    # eval: (compile (format ""latexmk -pdf -pvc %s"" ""10-article""))
    # End:

This is working fine, as soon as I modify the org file it gets exported to latex and then compiled to pdf. Amazing!

My problem is that I need to export to PDF using the first snippet I included since I need the `(ox-extras-activate '(ignore-headlines))` part. Ideally I would like to have that snippet as a separated file that I could call from both within emacs manually (`C-c C-c`) and also use the same code whenever the file changes on disk.

Could anyone tell me how to do it?

I will also drop my next question, after this I would like to integrate this with gitlab's CI, so I can build each PDF directly when I push a commit. So if this could be also linked to the prior solution, it would be very awesome!

Thank you very much.

I've been using mu4e more and more lately and it's been a pretty smooth ride so far. However, I still end up using Thunderbird to monitor my mailbox because the headers view is not super usable by default, mainly because of email threads.

The issue is that I end up receiving mails part of both ginormous and active threads, so both the threading view on or off (`mu4e-headers-toggle-threading`) is inadequate since my screen gets filled by pretty much a single thread (either because threading view is on, so the whole thread gets shown, or because the threading view is off, so tons of fresh replies are shown).

Ideally I would like to have the same view as I have in Thunderbird: all threads collapsed by default, i.e. just a single entry per thread (the topmost mail) but the with the update time of the last reply to that thread. I can then quickly see if any thread has been updated, and dive into it with `a` -> `s`.

In particular, I missed expansion to emphasis markers, in similar fashion as for quotes or parenthesis.  So I baked one, and shared it in [last week's ""Weekly tips/tricks/etc/ thread""](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/f5oj0x/weekly_tipstricketc_thread/fi8nj9t/).  u/github-alphapapa commented on it and came up with a marking function suggesting a more general approach, also based on Org element API.  The critical difference in github-alphapapa's take, relative to fuco1's functions, is the use of `org-element-context` instead of `org-element-at-point`, thus being able to reach much more granular data.  I liked the suggestion very much, and thought it was the way to go, so I went spelunking at `org-element.el` to see this through.  The thing evolved into something somewhat more elaborate and consistent.  That given, u/SlowValue asked/suggested that I opened a new thread with the results.  Thus this post.

The code is below, but before that, some comments:

- I think the result is already reasonably consistent, and works well for the cases I could come up with.  But, beware, this is still lightly tested.

- The use of Org element API's elements and objects hierarchy in this way to expand successive regions, especially when other expansions come into play -- such as the ones that ship by default with `expand-region`, in particular to symbols and similar units, and sentences -- is bound to be somewhat complicated.  This because of the complexity of a typical Org document, and the fact that these multiple expansion units do not necessarily nest within each other, but they intersect partially as we follow the hierarchy chain.  As a result, not always will you be able to expand to the region you desire from any given point.  Exactly which will be chosen will depend on the heuristics of `expand-region`.  I've tried to control for some more conspicuous cases in these functions, but these attempts are far from exhaustive.  Namely: 1) the expansion to a symbol unit within an emphasis region; 2) the expansion to a sentence within quotes; 3) and a tricky corner case which emerges when the starting point of an object, such as an emphasis region, coincides with the starting point of the element that contains it, making it harder to know which is the proper parent element to choose from, to follow the document structure.  The solution I found is to follow the grandparent element when the imediate parent is of `paragraph` type, for a number of types of objects.  I'm not sure, though, if this is really the general rule to this issue.  If anyone with a deeper knowledge of the Org element API and Org syntax could share their thought on this, I'd be specially thankful.

- As a result of the previous, I've chosen to disable or rewrite a sizable number of default expansions.  This selection is undoubtedly somewhat a matter of personal preference.  The same with the trouble I went to control for the interaction between quotes and sentences (I've left a simpler `gb/er/mark-org-sentence` there, if you prefer).

- This does not work ideally with `org-hide-emphasis-markers`, in the sense that if you expand to `gb/er/mark-org-element-inside` or `gb/er/mark-org-symbol` in an emphasis object and kill/copy the region, the starting emphasis marker is included in the kill ring.  This unfortunately is not a result of this function itself, which places point as due (try to call it directly and then kill), but of the way `expand-region` calls it and then stores point.  So it's sort of hard to fix (If anyone knows how, please let me know).

Comments are welcome.  And anyway, I hope you enjoy it too.

I'm looking for a way to emulate the JetBrains IDE's ""smart whitespace"" feature, where it'll inspect the current buffer and match the current whitespace to what it finds. At the very least, it properly detects between spaces/tabs and I believe it also detects the indentation depth.

This is useful for if you are working in multiple projects of the same language, that use different formatting conventions. There would still be a default used when starting new buffers.

When that is loaded, links are not displayed correctly.

I'm trying to figure out why my links in org-mode documents are showing as plain text rather than a formatted link.

Example:

    ** DONE List common dependencies among all projects
    CLOSED: [2020-02-10 Mon 15:05]
    ** NEXT Code review of each project's production Helm charts

    ** NEXT Jenkins Jobs
    [[file:../../20200224101502_jenkins_jobs.org][Jenkins Jobs]]
    Plan with Alice to review jobs.
    ** TODO Decide monitoring requirements

That gets displayed like this: https://imgur.com/a/t06IYwQ

I am trying out [org-roam](https://github.com/jethrokuan/org-roam/) and have deft and org-journal installed too, so there's potentially a lot of stuff that can affect the display of that text. I'm also using Spacemacs rather than regular Emacs.

I've tried M-x font-lock-mode and org-toggle-link-display but neither changed the way those file links are styled.

Is there a way to select some text in Emacs and find out what settings are applied to that text? Kind of like the way you can do an ""Inspect Element"" in Firefox or Chrome/Electron-based apps?

Failing that, is there a good method for debugging Emacs display of documents? I was wondering if I went through these steps, I might be able to figure out what's going on, or at least narrow it down:

* Emacs with no startup file
* Emacs with startup file that loads org-mode
* Emacs, org-mode, deft.
* etc, etc until I find what breaks it.

Sorry to ask so many questions, I hope what I'm after is clear. Thank you all in advance, this is such a helpful subreddit you've already saved me from so many problems!",1582595642.0

**Motivation**  

We've all at some point experienced the loop of setting a binding, forgetting about it, then having to look it up in our own config. One day I stumbled across the wonderful [`omni-quotes.el`](https://github.com/AdrieanKhisbe/omni-quotes.el) package which prints small little messages in the echo area whenever emacs is idle, and I thought *wouldn't it be nice if I could harness this to remind me of my bindings from time to time?*

Here I present [`remind-bindings.el`](https://github.com/mtekman/remind-bindings.el) which shows you all the `global-set-key` or `use-package` bindings in your config, grouped by package.

**Installation**


    (use-package remind-bindings
      :hook (after-init . remind-bindings-initialise)
      :bind ((""C-c C-d"" . 'remind-bindings-toggle-buffer)   ;; toggle buffer
             (""C-c M-d"" . 'remind-bindings-specific-mode))) ;; buffer-specific only


**Usage**

You can see your bindings either at the global or **buffer-specific** level via a toggleable side-buffer using the above bindings. If you want to see periodic reminders in the echo area,  you simply need to turn `omni-quotes-mode` on.",1582570631.0

https://www.gnu.org/software/hyperbole

In preparation for Hyperbole version 8, we have produced another two test releases with many bug fixes and a number of new features.  There are a lot of improvements in the Org-mode support in the ""hsys-org.el"" file.

It is not hard to install but it is not automated as an Emacs package manager install would be; only non-test releases are published via the Emacs package manager.  This is the release I run every day, so it is good enough to use daily though only minimal testing has been done on the full release.

Here is what is new (see notes for test releases 7.1.0 and 7.0.9):

[https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/hyperbole.git/tree/HY-NEWS](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/hyperbole.git/tree/HY-NEWS)

or

[https://github.com/rswgnu/hyperbole/blob/master/HY-NEWS](https://github.com/rswgnu/hyperbole/blob/master/HY-NEWS)  


———

Here are instructions for installation:

If you already have a Hyperbole git repo, then just pull this latest release from master:

    git pull  


Otherwise, move to some path in the filesystem where you want to keep Hyperbole  
and clone the git repository:  


    git clone [https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/hyperbole.git](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/hyperbole.git)  


cd to the hyperbole folder that was just created. (This is the  
PATH-TO-HYPERBOLE-FOLDER that is mentioned below.)  


    cd hyperbole  


Byte compile the files if you like:  


    make bin  


Or to simply run from source do a:

    make src

Now you need to load Hyperbole into your emacs. Edit your ""\~/.emacs"" file and insert the lines:  


    (add-to-list 'load-path ""PATH-TO-HYPERBOLE-FOLDER""))  
    (load ""hyperbole-autoloads"")  
    (load ""hyperbole"")  


Restart your emacs or evaluate the lines above in your running emacs and you are done.

I miss the IDE-like behaviour IDEs have, and sure, I could just install a bunch of plugins, and even though I like to play around with things from time to time, I actually don't have the time nor do I really want to spend hours and hours to configure a text editor, so that it acts like an IDE. That just feels kind of stupid.

So I decided I'd try out emacs, since I heard that you can have vim keybindings (with evil-mode) .

So I installed doom emacs, and so far I like it, I still need to get used to some of the keybindings and the moving around, and so on, but I like it for now.

But, in vim I could just use ctrl-c to go into normal mode (instead of escape), but that doesn't seem to be the case here.

So does anyone know where/how I'd be able to change that?

So I have an issue that I don't know how to fix. Part of why I don't know how to fix it, is that I don't know where to start looking or what is at fault. So I have come to you asking for help.

# The problem
In short, the problem is that I have a multi-monitor setup, and would like to open an Emacs frame on a separate monitor (or move one there after creation), but I don't know how.

That might seem easy, but because I use EXWM as my window manager, I can't just pick up a frame and drag it over.

The other monitors are on and connected (though completely black). I can drag the cursor over them and move floating windows there. No issue.

Looking at the emacs documentation, I found the [section on multiple displays](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Multiple-Displays.html), but when using `make-frame-on-display`, the only display it seems to recognize is ""0"", which just creates another frame on the current monitor.

Because of all this, I don't know whether this is an EXWM thing or an Emacs thing. I thought about turning to the EXWM repo and ask for help, but I don't want to bother them if this isn't an EXWM thing at all. Furthermore, it could very well be that I just don't have enough experience with Linux to know how to specify displays or that I'm missing something else.

# `xrandr`
There may be some confusion as to the difference between a display, a monitor, and a screen. `xrandr` displays `Screen 0` with three connected displays following. 
```sh
Screen 0: minimum 8 x 8, current 8880 x 2160, maximum 32767 x 32767
eDP1 connected 3840x2160+5040+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 340mm x 190mm
  # resolutions
DP1 connected 1200x1600+0+280 left (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 410mm x 310mm

I am a software developer working on golang stack. My company pays for Goland subscriptions (which I have taken btw). About a couple of years back, I saw one of my colleagues using Emacs and that's how I got introduced to it. Using Ctrl, Meta and other modifier keys were painfully frustrating at first, but I got used to it pretty quickly.

Over the course of next year or so I started using Emacs for anything programming related. When I moved to a team working on golang, I modified my .emacs with go-mode specific settings, etc. The development experience was OKAY. I got some features working but had problems with others (`gocode` was slow; official version didn't support vendored packages etc). I am sure that others have found solutions/workarounds for these, I blame myself for not investing more time to debug the slowness, but still.

When I heard the news about Emacs 27 having native JSON parsing support, I installed a nightly build and started using `lsp-mode` for my daily development. However, more often than not, my general experience would occasionally still be really slow (even after using the recommended settings for various modes, etc). Every now and then I would get frustrated and switch to Goland for a while before coming back to Emacs again.

Yesterday, I decided to finally sit down and try to fix the problem. I invested about half a day to fix my config. The result, I have a lightning-fast development environment thanks to `lsp-mode`, `company-lsp`, `lsp-ui` and `flycheck`. 

TL; DR: I am really really happy that I invested time to debug why my Emacs27 + `lsp-mode` was slow. Now it is much faster resulting in an amazing experience.",1582294803.0

Write some more code, run the tests. Lather, rinse. repeat. 

As it is now, the test-work.lisp uses ql to load lisp-unit, then loads the work file. So running this file will run the tests C-c C-k. When modifying the work file I do C-c  C-k, then switch to the test window and do C-c C-k.

nhnsn31,Passing nil as an argument from eshell,1.0,False,False,1,f72042,emacs,https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/f72042/passing_nil_as_an_argument_from_eshell/,2,"Once of my favorite features of eshell is the hybrid Lisp-Bash syntax. It's great for being able to use Lisp functions on the file system, for example to pass relative paths of files to a Lisp function. 

For example, I have a Lisp function that runs a Python process on a Python script, while filtering its verbose output.  It's called `run-verbose-proc`. The command I've set up looks like this (formatted with eshell prompt):

`c:/Users/neil/Desktop $ run-verbose-proc` [`main.py`](https://main.py)

And I get nicely formatted output. Once in a while, I'd like a different configuration for the output, so I've set up `run-verbose-proc` to accept an optional second and third parameter to tweak some settings. I commonly have the need to call something like:

`c:/Users/neil/Desktop $ run-verbose-proc` [`main.py`](https://main.py) `nil t`

You can probably guess the problem. eshell, like many shells, seems to coerce its input into strings. What gets passed into `run-verbose-proc` is the string `""nil""`, a truthy value, instead of the falsey `nil`. This makes it tricky to use any Lisp functions that require a falsey argument.

This wouldn't be an issue if I wrapped the whole thing in parenthesis (so that it's evaluated purely as a Lisp form), but then I wouldn't get to use my relative ""[main.py](https://main.py)"" path. I'd love a way to ""splice"" the relative path of ""main.py"" into a Lisp form using eshell dollar expansion, but that doesn't seem to work inside of S-expressions. For example, this results in a syntax error:

`c:/Users/neil/Desktop $ (run-verbose-proc ${`[`mai`](https://main.py)`n.py} nil t)`

I know there's other ways of doing this, and I've worked around it in different ways. I like eshell and I like this workflow, so I wanted to see if anyone has ideas of how to force eshell to pass the `nil` value.  I couldn't find anything on Google, so if anyone has an answer maybe we'll help out the next person to come along.",1582270576.0

Ashjkaell,Capturing Website URL with org-capture and exwm,0.75,False,False,4,f6zzux,emacs,https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/f6zzux/capturing_website_url_with_orgcapture_and_exwm/,4,"Hi everyone!  I just wanted to share a puny hack to fix a common annoyance I had;  When reading a website in FF/IceCat/Chromium.. you might want to just save the url to an org file.

Of course, you can just copy and paste the url, but It's much more fun to write a bit of elisp.  (I know there are well-engineered solutions out there to capture from firefox but they require an extension and I'm very lazy.)

The awesome EXWM has a function called `exwm-input--fake-key` that is able to send key events.  The plan is just to send `C-l C-c` to select and copy the URL, then we can paste it from system selection.

The problem is that the capture template is in another window (or maybe even another frame!), so we modify the exwm function to send to an X window with a specific ID:

    (defun exwm-input--fake-key-to-id (event id)
      ""Fake a key event equivalent to Emacs event EVENT and send it
     to program with x window ID.""
      (let* ((keysym (xcb:keysyms:event->keysym exwm--connection event))
         keycode)
    (when (= 0 (car keysym))
      (user-error ""[EXWM] Invalid key: %s"" (single-key-description event)))
    (setq keycode (xcb:keysyms:keysym->keycode exwm--connection
    					   (car keysym)))
    (when (/= 0 keycode)
      (dolist (class '(xcb:KeyPress xcb:KeyRelease))
        (xcb:+request exwm--connection
    	(make-instance
    	 'xcb:SendEvent
    	 :propagate 0 :destination id
    	 :event-mask xcb:EventMask:NoEvent
    	 :event
    	 (xcb:marshal
    	  (make-instance
    	   class
    	   :detail keycode :time xcb:Time:CurrentTime
    	   :root exwm--root :event id :child 0 :root-x 0 :root-y 0
    	   :event-x 0 :event-y 0 :state (cdr keysym) :same-screen 0)
    	  exwm--connection)))))
    (xcb:flush exwm--connection)))

Then you can easily define a function to get the URL:

     (setq user-browser-name ""Firefox"") ;Or IceCat, probably Chromium, etc too!
     (defun my--get-url-from-firefox ()
       (interactive)
       ;; We get the xwindow id of the buffer named Firefox
       (let ((fid (exwm--buffer->id (get-buffer user-browser-name))))
     ;; Send c-l to select url
     (exwm-input--fake-key-to-id 'C-l fid)
     ;; We sleep to avoid race conditions.
     (sleep-for 0 300)
     ;; Copy url to kill ring (note: this is not affected by simulation keys)
     (exwm-input--fake-key-to-id 'C-c fid)
     (sleep-for 0 300)
     (current-kill 0)))

(It seems to require the sleeps on my machine, but time can probably be decreased)

And of course, we can now add a capture template like:

    (""w"" ""Website"" entry (file+headline org-default-notes-file ""Webpages"")
     ""* TODO %?\n %(my--get-url-from-firefox)"")

More than a question I wanted to discuss pros and cons of each approach.  It'd seem a decent approach to reuse the same variable for the indentation size no matter what programming language we'd be in, but some modes use their own vars, and that makes it super difficult to 'sell' to non-already-emacs-hackers. I assume the modes that use their own thing have their reasons, but just to recap the many things that may affect indentation:

There are:

- tab-width
- variables like lua-indent-level, typescript-indent-level,... 
- modes like dockerfile-mode that overwrite indent-line-function (and internally ends up using tab-width as the multiplier)
- .editorconfig? tsmt.json?  (depending on modes you enable, emacs adds those configs into account)
- lsp-enable-indentation

I consider myself a decent emacser, and it takes me ages to setup such a simple thing as indentation for new environments, and that makes me sad :(.

Do they really mean **annoying**, or **infuriating** or just plain _disconcerting_?

For someone new to Lisp I find it easier to grasp the structure when closing parentheses line up with their opening parentheses and I like to write Lisp in that way. I am yet to grok why piling a long set of parentheses at the end of line makes sense for Lisp.

I feel like I still don't fully grok what he is saying. Hoping some smart person here can help me out :)

As I understand it currently, all elisp primitives are really C functions, so interpreted elisp will call those primitives to make things happen. Byte compiling saves the interpretation step and adds some optimization, but is still using the runtime to call C functions.

From what I understood what Tom was saying, we could use something like libjit or MIR to translate the elisp directly to machine code on the fly. This means you don't need the C runtime. only C you would need is for libraries. 

I don't understand how this would work in practice. Would you lose all of the introspection of elisp? How would you handle garbage collection if you don't have a runtime environment anymore? What about needing to instrument a function for edebug or adding advice's? It seems like you would loose all the nice parts of elisp if you compile it to machine code. And wouldn't even machine-compiled elisp be slower then code compiled from C?

And as far as bootsrapping goes, he is saying that this jit functionality would be written in elisp that translates to C. but then you could use that to bootstrap to where you don't even need the C part and instead just have an elisp JIT written in elisp that uses the previous version of the compiler to translate to machine code. Did I get that right? I don't understand why you even need to bootstrap if you can use libjit to translate elisp directly to machine code? Why do you need to translate it to C?",1582162648.0

Thank you all so much for your insight! I thought my rant would just disappeared unnoticed, but I got some much feedback! Positive and encouraging one, so thanks a lot ✌️
**END EDIT2**

I've been trying emacs for about a year now. So far I've used Microsoft OneNote (one a surface pro 3 with pen) during my bachelor in biology: great for lectures. I then shifted to Linux with RStudio+vimtex and a bullet journal (pen&paper) for my master since I started to do more bioinformatics and I needed to organize multiple projects for school and work. A year ago I started a PhD (why did I do that?? 😅🤦‍♂️) and I got interested in Emacs and Org-mode. It seemed great and with multiple users in academia.

I tried bare Emacs, a personal config, a personal config on Prelude, Doom emacs and I always end up switch around them! Either it's too much to configure or someone else's config always feel out of place (hard to edit, when something doesn't work it's hard to look for solutions, odd behaviours, etc)! Both Doom emacs and prelude are fantastic (I have to say, Doom amazes me many times), but more often than not I just have to run emacs -Q to do something in org-mode the way the manual explain it.

But that's not the main thing: I thought emacs and org-mode would simplify my life: organised searchable notes and to-do lists; elegant and straightforward prose+code; agenda that integrate with my phone via GCal and Orgzly. Yet, I find myself wasting time constantly tinkering with emacs without ever achieving what I want. While pen and paper was so streamlined: write I thing, tick when it's done, cross when it's cancelled.

How did you manage to streamline emacs while still keeping the niceties of searchable, well organized notes, to-do lists, and agenda?

Sorry for the rant 😁 PhD life is hard 😂
Thanks! ✌️

**EDIT1**

I thought I shall trying to expand on what I would like to achieve. The workflow I have in mind is the following. I'm open to suggestions.

  1. An *item* enters my ""to-do-candidate"" radar (either I have an idea or someone ask me to do something)
  2. The *item* is temporarily allowed in my to-do list (`~/inbox.org`) and the following things are quickly assigned
    * One area of responsibility (AOR) (e.g., PhD, personal growth, collaboration XY,...)
    * One or more @person (if any) affiliation
    * One TODO type (DO (physically), WRITE, READ, PONDER, DEFINE, CODE, TEST, GO-TO, *NewHabit*)
    * One (if any) deadline
    * One priority (very important (!), Important (+), neutral (•), maybe (?))
  3. Every evening my inbox is cleaned up and each item is either archived in a monthly datatree (without days), refilled to the appropriate project/area of responsibility notebook, or refilled to the general to-do list (`~/todo.org`). Ideally, items with priority `!` or `+` are always scheduled. *NewHabit* are refilled to my `~/routine.org` which is reviewed weekly to check if keeping or deleting an habit. My agenda should be built with all these files but the inbox. And I should be able to toggle the visibility based on tags, type, priority, etc.
  4. Every morning I can check my phone calendar and or Orgzly to see the tasks for today (with assigned time or whole day)

In addition to the organization part, I would like to be able to make sharable odt/doc documents (probably I'll always need MSOffice for that), take notes with math notation and code, execute R/bash/python code with integrated data visualization (*alla* RStudio), write my lab book with notes and heavy data collection (*alla* Excel)

        ""C c s u"" . (org-sql-user-update)
        ""C c s c"" . (org-sql-user-clear-all)

* I prefer doing things in a time boxed approach. I divide my day into different slots - primary, secondary and tertiary activities each with a time slot.
* I am firm believer in tracking habits, so I make sure I put an entry into a calendar that ""I did"" that on ""that day"" at ""that time"". This make me feel little accomplished and give me a sense of achievement. I do that to ensure I don't miss doing what I need to do too much in a row.
* Over the year (more than a decade) the only system that gives me maximum output is when I plan things on a calendar and I follow it. I tried using google sheets synced with calendar to visualise my day.

Problem

* I wanted to use only org-mode so I started using habits so those habits appear as time slots on my agenda. Any scheduled work also appear on the agenda. It kind of works but I miss the calendar view. Is there any recommendation for a calendar based agenda?
* Good thing about google sheets is that you can create reports/pivots to analyse what you did in the past few months, years. Not sure how easily I can do that in org-mode.
* Is there a way to define daily named time blocks. So I can move the todo entries quickly from one slot to another without changing the timestamp?

gonewest818,[ANN] elisp-lint 20200217.38 now available on MELPA,0.91,False,False,32,f50swc,emacs,https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/f50swc/ann_elisplint_2020021738_now_available_on_melpa/,10,"**elisp-lint** is a basic linter to validate elisp packages you are writing.

Today I pushed some significant changes which are now available in MELPA.

Changes:

* Print a simpler **summary report** of all tests organized by file, and sorted by line number.
* Integrate **package-lint** as a convenience. This was a long standing request.
* Also **removed the package-format check** (which used package-buffer-info under the hood) as package-lint is more comprehensive.
* **Colorized** the output for readability.
* Minimum requirement is now **Emacs 24.4 or newer**

Problems? Questions? Submit a ticket in the Github project:  [https://github.com/gonewest818/elisp-lint](https://github.com/gonewest818/elisp-lint)

However, here's one small caveat:

I took on maintenance of this project a while ago, and when ownership was transferred in github the URL to the project also changed.  It seems a common way to use elisp-lint is by putting something like the following in your travis-ci.yml file, or equivalent.   If you have this in your development workflow, please just be aware that you are frozen to the last version Nikolaj released.

    mkdir -p lib && curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nschum/elisp-lint/stable/elisp-lint.el > lib/elisp-lint.el
    
    $EMACS --version && find *.el -not -name ""tests.el"" | xargs $EMACS -Q --batch -l lib/elisp-lint.el -f elisp-lint-files-batch

Now of course everything is fine if that version works for you. But should you want to take a look at these newer features, please note the new project home is [https://github.com/gonewest818/elisp-lint](https://github.com/gonewest818/elisp-lint) and you'll need to edit your CI setup accordingly.

The biggest change is replacing the slow and bug-riddled Elisp-based export functionality with `fountain-export-command-profiles` allowing a very flexible interfacing with any number of the great [Fountain command line tools](https://github.com/rnkn/fountain-mode#exporting). A few example profiles are already defined for some tools I've found to be good quality.

There are a couple of v3 breaking changes:

* `fountain-align-[ELEMENT]` options are now cons-cells instead of two-element lists
* `fountain-note-template` option now uses `format-spec` instead of its own templating format

I'm pretty sure those are the only breaks with compatibility, but there might be others. For any problems, I suggest resetting via `M-x customize-option RET fountain-[OPTION]`.

For all changes, check out the [release notes](https://github.com/rnkn/fountain-mode/releases/v3.0.0).

Wondering if someone in the community can point me in the right direction: I'm running into an issue with Emacs for MacOS X (26.3, running on Catalina 10.15.2) where, if I have Emacs open already, I'm unable to open a file from the context menu in Finder (e.g. Right-click-> Open With->Emacs).

Vim has two characteristics that made me like it:

1) Available everywhere. I'm currently doing a project for school on a Jetson TX1 cluster, and Vim is there, but not Emacs or tmux. I don't code on computers I haven't already configured very often, but this is nice.

2) Great ergonomics, OOTB. The hardest thing to move away from is motions and text objects. I know eViL exists, but I'm reluctant to use it because hides away abstractions like the yank/kill ring that I'd like to get to know. I do use god-mode, however; I quite like it, since it gives nothing but a transparent layer over the defaults that keep my hands from being murdered by the Control key (exactly what I wanted).

Reasons I moved away from it:

First, the community is fragmented. Broadly speaking, there are three sub-communities of users, and they don't always get along with each other.

Group A really values what the Vim mainline comes with out of the box. Most of their contributions are scripts to make the defaults and built-in abstractions more bearable. This group includes people like Bram Moolenaar, the BDFL.

Group B values ergonomics, which involves introducing sane defaults at a more aggressive rate than A and introducing cleaner interfaces. I'd consider my contributions mostly in this category. Others include Tim Pope, a prolific Vimmer who maintains vim-fugitive (a Git wrapper that almost has feature parity with Magit) and Justin Keyes (lead maintainer of Neovim, a ""modernized"" fork of Vim.

Group C values interfacing with different dev toolchains. These are usually new Vimmers, usually coming from VScode (or more recently, Emacs), and they usually either want parity with VScode's features or API or want to evangelize people to plugin platforms that only solve problems people in VScode would have.

Most interactions involve C trying to validate its use cases to A, or A yelling at C for not being pure enough. B gets along with both, but a lot of legacy code would have to be refactored before it gets the approval of either A or C.

The community is taking too many different directions, and there are compatibility issues left and right.

Also, the codebase is brittle and glued together by monolithic and inextensible abstractions. Of course, Bram is in love with those abstractions and isn't willing to merge anything that isn't a bug fix.

How I hope to use Emacs:

1) Learn the abstractions that Emacs provides OOTB (yank/kill/mark rings, Dired, TRAMP, etc.)

2) Generously introduce scripts that make defaults make sense and add functionality without another monolithic interface (SmartTab, woohoo!)

3) Use the fuck out of Magit (holy fuck, it's amazing!)

4) Read as much as I can from C-h and EmacsWiki and understand history and design decisions before signing up for some auto-magical platform that does it all for you (*coughs* SpaceMacs *coughs*)

Any advice and discussion would be well-received and appreciated!

Edited to add that I also want not to have to configure anything that's not in Emacs (except maybe the shell, depending on whether or not I like eshell). There's nothing worse than having to port and debug 20-something platform-specific config files each time I move computers. I'd much rather just install the latest stable Emacs and my init.el and be done with it.",1581748166.0

nv-elisp,[ANN/RFC] DOCT new feature: disabling templates,0.9,False,1581724361.0,7,f3ygvi,emacs,https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/f3ygvi/annrfc_doct_new_feature_disabling_templates/,5,"One of the benefits of [doct](https://github.com/progfolio/doct/) is that it validates as much as it can about your templates **before** you run org-capture.

Here's a situation I've run into with vanilla Org capture templates:

    (let ((org-capture-templates '((""t"" ""Type typo"" entrée (file """") nil))))
      (message ""There's a typo in my template, but I'm blissfully unaware."")
      (message ""Time to get some work done."")
      (sit-for 1)
      (message ""Something came up that I want to capture."")
      (condition-case err
          (org-capture nil ""t"")
        (error (message ""Oh no! An error with one of my templates!
    I'd better fix that or take a note to fix it or...
    What was I capturing in the first place?""))))

I've not only lost the context of what I was doing, but I've lost the context of what I wanted to capture and have to remember to fix that template.

doct will emit user-errors for these sorts of mistakes so you can catch them while you're defining your templates:

    (let ((org-capture-templates (doct '((""Type typo"" :keys ""t"" :type entrée :file """"))))))

throws an error showing you the values it accepts for the keyword you've incorrectly set, the value you set it to, and the form it was processing when it threw the error:

    user-error: 
    DOCT Wrong type argument: 
    (entry item checkitem table-line plain), 
    entrée, (""Type typo"" :keys ""t"" :type entrée (file """") nil)

This makes it easy to pinpoint and fix the error before it surprises you at capture time.

Here's another situation I've run into:

    (let ((org-capture-templates
            (doct '((""Some-function broken"" :keys ""t"" :file """"
                     :template some-fucntion)))))
      (org-capture nil ""t""))

There's no way to tell before running some-function that it is broken. So the first time you go to capture, you'll hit the scenario described above. Maybe you don't have time to fix the template, or aren't sure how. Instead of remembering ""don't use that template, it's broken"" you can temporarily disable it.
The [:disabled](https://github.com/progfolio/doct#disabling-templates) keyword allows just that.
Setting it to `t` causes doct to ignore the template altogether. It isn't processed, and it isn't included in your org-capture-templates.

This can useful for disabling entire groups of templates, too:

    (doct '((:group ""Enabled""  :file """"
                    :children ((""One""    :keys ""1"")
                               (""Two""    :keys ""2"")
                               (""Three""  :keys ""3"")))
            (:group ""Disabled"" :disabled t :file """"
                    ;;normally, this would throw a type error for the :keys
                    :children ((""Four""   :keys 4) 
                               (""Five""   :keys 5)
                               (""Six""    :keys 6)))))

returns:

    ((""1"" ""One""   entry (file """") nil)
     (""2"" ""Two""   entry (file """") nil)
     (""3"" ""Three"" entry (file """") nil))

    (let ((svg (svg-create 100 100 :stroke-color ""black"")))
      (svg-line svg 50 10 50 90)

Is there any reason for not implementing something like that in `org-mode`. If there are no obvious reasons for not having something like that in `org-mode` maybe I send a feature request.

## The standard Org-way to generate and show SVG images

Above I used text properties to display an SVG image. I chose that example since it is quite impressive. But, this post is not solely about displaying images generated through Elisp but general on text properties put on texts generated by Elisp source blocks.

I wanted to point out that there is also an official way to include Elisp generated SVG images. One can use the `:file` argument of Org source blocks for that purpose:

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :file 2020-02-14/test.svg :exports results
    (let ((svg (svg-create 100 100 :stroke-color ""black"")))
      (svg-line svg 50 10 50 90)
      (svg-line svg 10 50 90 50)
      (svg-circle svg 50 50 25 :stroke-color ""red"" :fill-color ""blue"")
      (with-temp-buffer
        (svg-print svg)
        (buffer-substring-no-properties (point-min) (point-max))))
    #+END_SRC
    
    #+RESULTS:
    [[file:2020-02-14/test.svg]]

It stores the image in the file with the given name. The file can be shown in the Org buffer by `M-x org-display-inline-images`.

Note also that even avoiding the external file for the image could be done different. One could implement a new entry `img` for `org-link-parameters` as demonstrated in [that Entry on emacs.stackexchange.com](https://emacs.stackexchange.com/q/41544/2370).

## The main problem with my approach

Text properties in strings generated by Elisp source blocks interfere with the fontification of `org-mode`. I've already tried to change text properties in the result string to `font-lock-face` (with appropriate leader `face normal`). But that didn't work for the `display` property.

There is also the minor problem that the text properties are not exported yet. I am positive that this could be done.",1581729260.0

I use windows and the startup is \~1-2 mins and the half of the time is spending that the emacs try to load the files with "".el"" "".elc"" "".el.gz"" "".elc.gz"" "".dll"" "".dll.gz"" suffixes.

It is okay but I would like to remove the .gz and .dll suffixes because I think it is not neccessary for me ...

I tried to this:

`(setq` 

 `load-suffixes '("".el"" "".elc"")`

 `load-file-rep-suffixes '("""")`

 `jka-compr-load-suffixes '("""")`

 `jka-compr-inhibit t)`

but I see that it is no affect for the loading.

lsp-pyls-server-command is considered risky so every time I open a python file in this directory I have to answer a question if I want to apply the value to the risky variable. There's no '!' option to save my answer so that I next time do not have to answer the same question. To fix this I have this configuration in my init.el;

In the :init section I add the value of lsp-pyls-server-command to the safe-local-variable-values list.

Everything works after this, the pyls language server is activated.

I tried placing the add-to-list statement outside and before the use-package statement for lsp-mode but it does not make any difference, it doesn't take effect.

I really enjoy the Fira Code font and its ligatures - when I wanted to try out ligatures in Emacs, I found [these instructions on the FiraCode repo](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/wiki/Emacs-instructions#using-prettify-symbols) to turn them on (I went with the prettify-symbols approach), and I thought to myself that their code sample would be pretty easy to just put into a package.

Being unable to find it already packaged up by somebody else, I decided to do it myself as my very first Emacs Lisp project! Here's the result: [https://github.com/jming422/fira-code-mode](https://github.com/jming422/fira-code-mode)

Beyond simply packaging up the sample code, I also added a customize option with which you can disable certain ligatures. I found that a couple of the stranger ligatures interfered with syntax highlighting for Clojure reader macros, and some of the ligatures I just didn't want (e.g. turning `x` into a multiplication symbol). Now I can select which ligatures I don't want to see, and the rest keep on working.

Anyway, hope this is helpful! I'm an elisp noob, so feedback is welcome in order for me to learn :)

This package - `emacs-compile-plus` - enhances the `compile` function to make it smoother to use. At least that's what I think.

My first complaint with the stock `compile` is that there is no interactive way to select the folder in which to run a command. With this package, the first thing `compile` does is to ask for the directory to run into.

My second complaint is that the buffer name is not unique enough. I often tend to run simultaneously multiple different commands in the same directory and with the stock `compile` the second command I run would overwrite the first one (I need to kill the first buffer to run the second one). For example, I run the tests in one compile buffer and the documentation server in a second one, both from the root directory of a project. The documentation says I should rename the first compile buffer then run the second but that's _so_ cumbersome. Instead, this package provides a name for the compile buffer that's the directory name followed by the full command that's being run.

I do a lot of Linux/BSD sysadmin, now moving to DevOps. I also do Ruby programming among other things.

I never really got into Vim or Emacs because I was foolishly off-put by the learning curve. But as of a week ago I realized this was a foolish mistake, and if I had a time machine, I'd go back and force myself to learn one. Apparently, I've spent most of my career doing things the long/hard way simply because I didn't want to learn Emacs. 

I've started looking for, and following YouTube channels going over Emacs. Naturally, any system as expansive as Emacs will have differing opinions on how you should incorporate it into your life.

There are two issues (currently) that I'm not exactly clear on, even after doing some research.

## Terminal vs GUI
I live at my ZSH shell and try to avoid GUIs. For example, when Ubuntu added a GUI package manager for Apt (now Snap, too) it didn't really interest me, til this day I continue to use APT at the command line.

So I had initially thought I would stick to Emacs terminal, which is what I've been using. But then I [read someone's opinion piece](https://blog.aaronbieber.com/2016/12/29/don-t-use-terminal-emacs.html), and it's said GUI is better than terminal for everything. 

But, I remember reading somewhere that if you're planning on remoting into servers, terminal is the way to go.

Which way does this subreddit prefer? Mind you, I don't plan on installing any Xserver on any remote server.

## To TRAMP or not
I make use of ssh_config host entries and ssh auth keys to login to all my remote servers.

The video I'm following has me do a M-x *shell*, which appears to just open a buffer(?) of my normal terminal. So I thought that I can just do my normal `ssh hostentry` or `ssh user@host` from here.

Then I heard about TRAMPS, and reading the official overview, it seems like it's what I should be using.

But what does this subreddit think?

I'm still quite the novice when it comes to customization. I recently was inspired by org-mode discussions here to finally dive in and start using it, since I was already looking for an escape route from Evernote.

My current frustration is with nested lists. I've been using lists extensively (recipes, specifically) and I regularly need to introduce a nested list under an item. 99% of the time it's an unordered list under an ordered one.

It seems like the ideal way to do so would be to leverage `C-j` (`org-indent-line`): it's very close to what I want, but I need it to add a `+` (or other list marker), and I don't see any way to customize its behavior.

Before I discovered that, I created a keyboard macro (`[M-return M-right ?\C-u ?1 ?\C-c ?-]`) which does fine, but finding a good keyboard shortcut is difficult. `C-M-<RET>` corresponds nicely to `M-<RET>` and `C-<RET>` which trigger similar semantics, but I can't figure out how to map it.

`(local-set-key (kbd ""C-M-return"") 'my-org-sublist)` gives me the error `C-M- must prefix a single character, not return`. `(local-set-key (kbd ""C-M-\r"") 'my-org-sublist)` (which the help indicates would be the correct syntax) indicates success when executed, but gives me the error `<C-M-return> is undefined` when I invoke the key combo, as does `C-M-<RET>`.

I've been rewriting my init.el during the last few days switching to straight.el as my package manager, and I'm now stuck trying to get org-ql to load properly.

Only the following functions are available when running M-x.

* org-ql-view
* org-ql-view-delete
* org-ql-search
* org-ql-view-sidebar
* org-ql-view-save
* org-ql-view-switch
* org-ql-view-customize
* org-ql-view-revent-items
* helm-org-ql
* helm-org-ql-agenda-files
* helm-org-ql-views
* helm-org-ql-org-directory

When running most of them I jut get the following error: `eval-buffer: Cannot open load file: No such file or directory, transient` which I think it indicates that the package is not loaded properly. When trying to run the org-ql-block functions they are not found.

The snippet from the last comment in [this issue](https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql/issues/29) just result in `Error (use-package): Cannot load org-ql-agenda`.

In my old config using package.el I just loaded org-ql with:

    (use-package org-ql
        :ensure t)

## How to reproduce the issue

Running the following elisp in a clean emacs -Q instance.

        ;; Bootsrap straight.el
        
        (defvar bootstrap-version)
        (let ((bootstrap-file
               (expand-file-name ""straight/repos/straight.el/bootstrap.el"" user-emacs-directory))
              (bootstrap-version 5))
          (unless (file-exists-p bootstrap-file)
            (with-current-buffer
                (url-retrieve-synchronously
                 ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raxod502/straight.el/develop/install.el""
                 'silent 'inhibit-cookies)
              (goto-char (point-max))
              (eval-print-last-sexp)))
          (load bootstrap-file nil 'nomessage))
        
        ;; Load use-package since I like the macro's syntax
        (straight-use-package 'use-package)
        
        ;; Install org-ql (melpa)
        (use-package org-ql
        :straight t)

Alternatively, substituting the last code block with either of the following ones and running `straight-pull-all` results in the same issue:

    ;; (master)
    (use-package org-ql
      :straight (:host github :repo ""alphapapa/org-ql""))
    
    ;; (last stable)
    (use-package org-ql

My code is here: [https://github.com/amoghpj/elisp-experiments/blob/master/create-forms-control.el](https://github.com/amoghpj/elisp-experiments/blob/master/create-forms-control.el). I am slowly becoming confident enough with elisp to request feedback from the community to learn more.

**Description:** The interactive function `create-forms-mode-control-file` prompts the user for the data file name (tab or comma separated for now), and the field separator. The `make-ctrl-file-body` function simply strings together some forms-mode settings. Mainly, it reads the header line of the file, and creates the argument for `forms-format-list`. Finally, this string is written to a control file with the .ctrl extension.

**General questions:**

1. Does such a functionality already exist in a package?
2. I am not sure if I have misunderstood the purpose of forms-mode, but would such a functionality be useful if extended to yaml files to have a clean interface to edit user configurations?

**Specific questions:**

1. Instead of creating a string and writing to file, would this be a use case for macros? Note, I am still trying to understand lisp macros.
2. Instead of setqs, should I be using let?

Thanks!",1581333449.0
SuccessfulElk,Newbie question: How do you manage your packages between computers?,0.94,False,False,12,f1jmwn,emacs,https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/f1jmwn/newbie_question_how_do_you_manage_your_packages/,23,"Is it possible to list packages in your `init.el` file somewhere and just call `package-install-list` or some such command?
As far as I can tell, I have to put my whole `.emacs.d/` directory under version control. But that would include all the actual packages.

In Vim, I use `plugged` which allows me to list the packages in my config file.

In JavaScript, a `package.json` file lets you name your dependencies for version control without committing the actual package contents.

Is there a similar pattern in emacs? Would love to hear how you've got your config set up.",1581330872.0
xei-jin,ol-get: retrieve outlook calendar entries,1.0,False,1581301886.0,15,f1j5q6,emacs,https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/f1j5q6/olget_retrieve_outlook_calendar_entries/,5,"Hello, I wanted to get Microsoft Outlook calendar entries into my diary/org-agenda at work, however I struggled to get `excorporate` working. Not wanting to invest any more time into debugging EWS (at the moment anyway) I decided to grab the data from the local outlook profile (PST/OST) using a python script.

Because it gets the data locally it's a bit faster than EWS (and no need to mess around with authentication) however there are certain scenarios where I imagine this approach is less ideal (e.g. shared calendars), and because it uses the COM api I'm afraid it's windows only.

If you view the entries in `org-mode` there are clickable links back to calendar entries (assuming you have `outlook:` style links setup). The python script attempts to install itself using `virtualenvwrapper` when the package first loads to save you the hassle.

Still plenty to do, in particular the calendar retrieval command is not very idempotent (moving a meeting time will cause a dupe entry) but mostly stuff I'm happy to deal with manually for now. Hopefully someone else finds it useful too.

github-alphapapa,Magit is like Git at the speed of thought,0.98,False,1581355839.0,133,f1ayo1,emacs,https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/f1ayo1/magit_is_like_git_at_the_speed_of_thought/,57,"*Inspired by https://github.com/Malabarba/speed-of-thought-lisp*

An example of using Magit to do things very quickly, with few keystrokes.

Scenario: Make some changes to a file.  Save the file.  Display `magit-status`.  Realize I was on a branch instead of `master`, and there were uncommitted changes on the branch, too.  Need to make the same change on `master`, without the other uncommitted changes.

*Note: Using* cursor *instead of the Emacs term,* point.

Steps:

1.  Put cursor on hunk I want to commit to `master`.  Press keys `s z i` to stash only that change:
    -   **`s`:** Stage selected hunk.
    -   **`z`:** Display stash dispatcher.
    -   **`i`:** Stash index.
2.  Discard other uncommitted changes (they were just experimental, so no need to save them).  Press keys `j u k y`:
    -   **`j u`:** Jump to unstaged changes.
    -   **`k y`:** Discard changes at cursor and confirm.
3.  Checkout `master`, pop stash and commit changes.  Press keys `b b RET z p RET j u s c c`:
    -   **`b`:** Show branch dispatcher.
    -   **`b`:** Checkout branch.
    -   `RET`: Select default branch choice (in this case, `master`).
    -  `z`: Show stash dispatcher.
    -  `p`: Pop stash.
    -  `RET`: Select first stash and pop it.
    -   **`j u`:** Jump to unstaged changes.
    -   **`s`:** Stage changes at point.
    -   **`c`:** Show commit dispatcher.
    -   **`c`:** Commit staged changes.

To do all of those things without Magit would require something like the following commands:

1.  `git stash save -p --no-keep-index`, followed by confirming and rejecting each change in-order, not knowing whether a change is needed until it's displayed.  (AFAIK, there is no simple ""stash the index"" command.)
2.  `git reset --hard`
3.  `git checkout master`
4.  `git stash pop`
5.  `git add .`
6.  `git commit`

But with Magit, it's like flying through Git and making changes to a repo the way one can fly through text and make changes to it with Vim's modal commands: `s z i`,  `j u k y`, `b b RET`, `z p RET`, `j u s`, `c c`.  It's like speaking a language optimized for Git.  It becomes second nature, so I don't even have to think about the commands&#x2013;my fingers just do them.

Please feel free to share your own scenarios in which Magit does with a few keystrokes what would take several git commands with special options.

*Edit: I had left off the stash-popping commands.  Doing it from memory is harder than doing it interactively, where I can see what I'm doing.  :)*",1581294647.0

github-alphapapa,"[RFC] substlet: Define form-local macros without quoting/unquoting forms, to better organize code without incurring function call overhead",1.0,False,False,9,f1abxw,emacs,https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/f1abxw/rfc_substlet_define_formlocal_macros_without/,4,"In some of my recent projects I've been making more use of `cl-labels` to organize my code.  It works well, however it means adding more function calls in the expanded code, which does have some performance impact.  For example, see Chris Wellons' [article about function aliasing](https://nullprogram.com/blog/2019/12/10/) and how it compares to code that the byte-compiler can optimize.

An obvious alternative to `cl-labels` is `cl-macrolet`, which works fine, but since it's the local equivalent of `defmacro`, it requires quoting forms and unquoting arguments within them.  This is tedious and error-prone.

An interesting Emacs feature is `defsubst` (as well as its close cousin, `define-inline`), which defines a function that can be inlined.  When byte-compiled, it's similar to using a macro, but it doesn't require quoting the function form, so it's easier to use.

So I found myself wishing for a local version of `defsubst`, one that would allow me to define local macros without requiring quoting forms and unquoting arguments.  So I came up with this:

    (defmacro substlet (substs &rest body)
      ""Like `macrolet' with `defsubst' semantics.
    In other words, like `defsubst', defining SUBSTS to be expanded
    in BODY.  In other words, like `macrolet', but macro bodies need
    not be backquoted, and arguments need not be unquoted within
    them.  In other words, like `flet', but bodies are inlined
    instead of called as functions (i.e. they are not functions, so
    they can't be used with `map' or `funcall').
    
    The purpose of this macro is to allow for clearer organization of
    code within functions while avoiding 1) the function call
    overhead of `flet' and `labels', and 2) the need to backquote
    bodies and unquote arguments of `macrolet'.""
      (declare (indent defun))
      (let ((macros
             (mapcar
              (lambda (subst)

                                       if (eq '&rest arg)
                                       do (setf rest-p t)
                                       else
                                       collect (cons arg (if rest-p
                                                             (cons 'list (list (quote \,) arg))
                                                           (list (quote \,) arg)))))
                             (comma-body (cl-sublis comma-args body)))
                  (append (list name args)
                          (list (cons 'backquote (list (cons 'progn comma-body)))))))
              substs)))
        `(cl-macrolet ,macros ,@body)))

Here's an example of using it:

    (let ((layout ""twopi"")
          (node '(element (:raw-value ""HEADING"") children)))
      (substlet ((format-vals (&rest pairs)
                              (cl-loop for (key value) on pairs by #'cddr
                                       collect (format ""%s=\""%s\"";"" key value)))
                 (node-label (node)
                             (-let (((element (&plist :raw-value) children) node))
                               raw-value)))
        (list :label (node-label node)
              :values (format-vals ""layout"" layout
                                   ""bgcolor"" (face-attribute 'default :background)))))
    ;;=> (:label ""HEADING"" :values (""layout=\""twopi\"";"" ""bgcolor=\""#002b36\"";""))

That example is quite simple, of course, as each ""subst"" is only referred to once.  It's even more helpful when they're used multiple times within the body.

It seems to work pretty well.  Of course, like `cl-macrolet`, it doesn't allow use of `funcall` on the defined forms, which precludes the use of `mapcar`, etc.  But if you don't need to do that, it allows you to organize code more clearly (avoiding large, inlined forms that make code more deeply nested and harder to follow), without incurring the performance impact of extra function calls.

I'd appreciate any feedback from Elispers and package developers.

This leverages org-capture's [org-capture-templates-contexts](https://orgmode.org/manual/Templates-in-contexts.html) to allow users to define lists of rules for when and how a template should show in their capture selection menu.

For example, lets say our user is a studious lycanthrope named Dave who only needs certain templates during a full moon.
They might declare their templates like so:

When `david/full-moon-p` returns `t`, the capture menu will only show the ""Werewolf"" group of templates.
When it returns nil, it will show the ""Human"" group of templates.

A template's keys can also map to another template in a given context using the :keys keyword within a context rule.

      ""Return t when current-time is between 9am and 5pm.""
      (<= 9 (string-to-number (format-time-string ""%H"")) 17))

    (setq
     org-capture-templates
     (doct '((:group
              :template ""* TODO %?"" :file """"
              :contexts (:function ignore)
              :children ((""Work"" :keys ""w"" :file ""~/work.org"")
                         (""Play"" :keys ""p"" :file ""~/play.org"")
                         (""TODO"" :keys ""t"" :contexts ((:when   jack/working-p :keys ""w"")
                                                      (:unless jack/working-p :keys ""p"")))))))

When Jack calls `org-capture` during work, typing ""t"" will execute his ""Work"" template.
Outside of work, hitting ""t"" will execute his ""Play"" template.
""Work"" and ""Play"" do not appear individually in the capture selection menu.

Contexts support the following keywords:

* :in-buffer
* :unless-buffer
* :in-file
* :unless-file
* :in-mode
* :unless-mode
* :unless
* :when
* :function

In addition to :contexts, I've added an explicit [:custom](https://github.com/progfolio/doct#custom-data) keyword.
This allows one to add metadata for keywords that doct or org-capture already use.
For example:

    (doct '((""Music Gear"" :keys ""m"" :file """"
             :custom (:keys ""Moog""))))

Not necessary in most cases, but nice to have and can future-proof your metadata in the event that org-capture reserves one of your keywords internally.

Any comments, questions, suggestions are appreciated.

I'm trying to emulate the `treemacs` behavior of creating a new window which resist resizing. I'd name it a 'high priority window' of some sorts.

The thing is I stumbled upon the local variable `window-size-fixed` and set it to `height` which is the property I don't want the window to change. The problem is that whenever I kill other window, it resizes and takes the whole screen (What you'd expect a normal window to do in common scenarios).

I read the variable description in the docs also says

>Deleting a window or changing the frame's size may still change the window's size, if there is no choice.

Which led me to use the function `window-preserve-size` instead. I'm using it as:

`(window-preserve-size (selected-window) nil t)`

Which is not doing what I'm expecting it to do either.

What am I missing?

Some additional info

* My command to kill buffers also kills the window
* What I'm really trying to do is to have a persistent terminal as a horizontal split to travel with me around the project.

I'm trying to setup a webdev environment in emacs and I've already got some useful answers but I'm trying to copy a feature of VSCode that I find very helpful and I can't seem to do it.

Basically, in VSCode when you start typing a tag like : ``h1``, it'll prompt a completion with ``<TAB>``. It also works for tags attributes. 

In emacs (afaik) you have to type much more, at least ``<h1><\`` for completion or use a *different* snippet for each level/tag. 

My probably incomplete understanding was that using ``lsp`` with ``company``, either in ``html-mode`` or ``web-mode``, I should be able to come to something close or comparable.

What am I doing wrong?

I have a problem that I'm trying to resolve, but I have not found any help with online searches. I'm using swiper to search for occurrences of a word in a buffer. Let's say this is the buffer (myBuf.txt):

    Something here 
    ***** Some more things here *****
    Here be dragons 
    ***** Oh, we're at this point now *****
    ***** I'm seeing stars ******
    Mr Andersson...
    ***** My oh my, almost there ***** 
    Pfew, done

**What I want to achieve** is to remove any line that start with `*****` and is followed by a line that starts with `*****`. So in myBuf.txt the `***** Oh, we're at this point now *****` line. 

So, I'm using swiper. My search regex is `^\*` which basically means, all the lines that start with a `*`. I then go through the swiper results one by one `C-n` (in the minibuffer) and look in the main buffer to see if the next line starts with `*****`. If it does, I switch to the main buffer window (`C-x o` or `M-x other-window`) and delete that line.

THIS, **this is where the probelm arises**, because now swiper doesn't know that the main buffer has changed and when I go back to the swiper minibuffer and continue to the next occurrence of the ""word"", it will put the cursor on the line **after** the one starting with `*****`. 

&#x200B;

I hope what I described makes sense. Now my question is: Is there a way to refresh the swiper results (in the minibuffer) when the main buffer changes in any way? 

Also, if there is another way to obtain what I want achieve I'm open to suggestions.",1580941064.0

Godnyx117,I'm so tired....,0.44,False,1580895360.0,0,eyu5rg,emacs,https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/eyu5rg/im_so_tired/,44,"Well... bugs and problems always appear but this it too much! From the last 1-2 weeks I'm spending MANY hours on configuring emacs and for real.... It really starts getting SO annoying! It's fine getting bugs and problems in the beginning but it really starts getting annoying after things that SHOULD work, not working properly at all!

&#x200B;

**THE PROBLEM:** There are three packages that don't work properly! Spaceline (I have it in my config as powerline), diminish and all-the-icons. This three packages doesn't work when I launch emacs! Well Spaceline works but it doesn't get the right separator shape. Tho if I disable Dashboard, Speceline works perfect for some reason (So maybe Dasboard is the problem in this case)..... But nothing for all-the-icons and diminish, these tho doesn't work whatever I do.

**THE FUNNY PART**: Well I have a function that reloads the config, it is binded to `C-c C-o`. After launching emacs and then reloading the config, everything MAGICALLY works perfectly! Either I do something wrong or there is a SERIOUS bug!

&#x200B;

Anyways I'm really tired with Emacs cause it is really so annoying to have bugs and problems all the time even after 1+ week which I have spend tons of hours every day to make my config so I want even spend many more to find the solution. But I will upload my config for anyone that want to take a look and maybe be able to fix the problem. I'm not expecting anything but who knows...

If you are not familiar with the org config method you can find a video [he](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EX9PKK3EMaw&t=7s)[re!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EX9PKK3EMaw&t=7s)

And you can find my config file [here!](https://gist.github.com/Godnyx/839cbc44d81ff0a360c2328f3861bb0c)

&#x200B;

**EDIT:** I fixed everything! Diminish has to be loaded after all the other packages (thanks guys for remembering me that it works from top to bottom lol!), all-the-icons-worked without change anything (Unless in dired mode which I'm gonna fix) and the powerline problem fixed using `:defer1` (thanks to[FarTermo](https://www.reddit.com/user/FarTermo/) who mentioned that)!

One more time, thanks a lot guys for your help! I wish you all to have a nice day! ;)",1580868385.0

Yesterday I had another approach towards using emacs after more or less 5 years. I was vim guy for the most part of my life. I did the tutorial and fell in love with emacs. I have also installed auctex, and proceeded to work on an article. Below is an example of how I am currently working.

1. Add a paragraph.
2. C-x C-s to save the file.
3. C-c C-c after which ""Command \[pdflatex\]: "" message pops out at the bottom. I hit enter.
4. C-c C-c after which ""Command \[\\doc-view\]: "" message pops out at the bottom. I hit enter.
5. Prompt pops out: ""File nature.pdf changed on disk.  Reread from disk? (yes or no) "" I type ""yes"".

I found necessity of typing ""yes"" a little cumbersome, and found that adding:

    (add-hook 'doc-view-mode-hook 'auto-revert-mode);

to init.el file should solve the issue, and refresh the preview after tex file changes, however it did not work.

Question is, am I doing something wrong?",1580854745.0

This causes both Firefox and Chrome to generate an error when they try to display the image. When the additional xml is deleted the image displays alright.

Is there some option to suppress that message? 

It looks as though some command option to suppress the additional svg is not included, or the builds at sourceforge and plantuml website are adding that spammy message and graphic.

**UPDATE:**

I found the cause of the problem.

The plantuml plugin wraps the code in the babel block in a set of startuml/enduml tags and the example I used already had the tags present resulting in code like this getting sent for execution.

When it comes to `M-x` I was able to do it cause it is actually binded to an action (for me ""counsel M-x"" cause I use Swiper) but the other 3 are not binded to a specific action but rather they are ""special"" keybindings used in combination with others. For example can I bind `C-x` to `SPC` ? and let's say `C-h` to `h`? If I'm not wrong doesn't doom emacs and spacemacs do something similar? Or did they binded every single key by them selves? If yes, type ""F"" before answer this question!
2. How long will it take me to learn ""the Evil workflow"" and be productive and comfortable?
3. Are there any do's and don'ts (however it is spelled)?
4. And most importantly... Where to start? I know I have the documentation and the help system to learn they keybindings but this is boring and annoying! Especially for someone that have spend 5+ hours on emacs every day the last week (yep! That's me...) trying to learn about everything  fixing problems! Where can I start and learn about Evil? Any good videos,tutorial series,articles etc.? And is Evil 100% Compatible with Vim? If I watch Vim videos, tutorials, articles etc. does it count? Can someone share a config so I get some ideas? Especially a big one would be great!",1580788258.0
humbuckah,How would I go about deriving a theme from a known one?,0.84,False,False,4,eyckvj,emacs,https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/eyckvj/how_would_i_go_about_deriving_a_theme_from_a/,10,"Hi all,

I've found a couple of themes that I like for emacs, but they all have little things that I would like to change about them. For now, I've been doing a bunch of `set-face-attribute` calls in the `:config` section of my `use-package` statement, i.e.:

    (use-package leuven-theme
       :ensure t
       :config
       (load-theme 'leuven t)
       (set-face-attribute 'button nil :underline nil)
       )

But this feels clunky. I would like to derive my own theme from (let's say) leuven and add my own preferences over it, using the theme colors where appropriate. Does anyone have a snippet to start me up with this?

Thanks!",1580787767.0

I found the issue I had set this when using mutt to edit email.. why?  I'm not sure now it was 2 months ago I set the change acording to git blame..

And acording to the source of  mu4e-compose.el

*Background*: Yesterday I updated my [zsh configuration to use powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) which does a lot with unicode icons/characters/glyphs to indicate status and make things look pretty.  

Naturally I wanted to know what they all are and it provides a nice function to print them all out - `get_icon_names` so I dump the output of that to a file - `get_icon_names > p10k-icons` -  and open it in emacs.

As I scroll down the list, emacs crashes. After lots of head-scratching and many crashes later I managed to narrow it down to a single character: 🛠  

I haven't investigated further - there may be others that cause emacs to crash but at least I've isolated one that reliably causes the issue. I put just that character into a file and:


    $ emacs p10k-icons-2-glyph

I have come to the decision that my currant init.el file is a MESS.

For the last eighteen months to two years I have been adding stuff at random to my init file and now I have a huge unwieldy beast on my hands. So I would like to start again from scratch and create a more ordered file, Also I thought while I'm at it why not restart completely.

Now here I am hat in hand asking for advice on the following:

* I use Emacs as an all-singing-all-dancing editor so some form of intelligence is needed as well as syntax highlighting. For as many programming languages as possible. (kind of like to be as prepared as possible) \*what are the best packages for this?
* Some form of project management. \*Is this even possible?
* Now there are three packages that I deem to be required and they are Magit, Org-mode and Dashboard so any advice on those packages is very welcome. \*anyone know of a good setup for these?
* code review, diff, debug etc. \*I have no idea for this can any one help?
* API and documentation browsing / reading. \*can this be done?

I'm really wondering if I'm over-complicating things here. 

For context, I'm trying to build a functionality that will 

* take a timestamp as input *(current video playing in mpv)*, 
* find it's respective subtitle file 
* then return the current subtitles surrounding the timestamp
* insert text as a quotation src block in org-mode.

I'm doing this with the purpose of learning more Elisp, project development, and it will be useful for when I'm taking notes in online classes. 

This is a subset of that code. I particularly feel like I had to strong-arm `map` and `lambda` functions and am curious if there is a more simplistic or elegant way to solve this problem. 

## The Problem

All of my `.srt` files are formatted the same way, except that sometimes it will break a portion of text associated with a given time-range into two lines.

**example:**

    1
    00:00:00 --> 00:00:02
    This is some text.
    
    2
    00:00:02 --> 00:00:05""
    Sometimes is is spread across
    two strings,
    
    3
    00:00:00 --> 00:00:10
    but not always.

I have taken the approach of reading the file into a temp-buffer and splitting on `\n`. This gives me what I want for strings that don't have two lines. But breaks my code for key values that more than two lines.

So the idea is:

    ;; Start with this
    '(""1"" ""00:00:00 --> 00:00:02"" ""This is some text."" 
      ""2"" ""00:00:02 --> 00:00:05"" ""Sometimes is is spread across"" ""two strings,""  
      ""3"" ""00:00:00 --> 00:00:10"" ""but not always."")
    
    ;; Turn it into this, but it's wrong
    '((""1"" ""00:00:00 --> 00:00:02"" ""This is some text."") 
      (""2"" ""00:00:02 --> 00:00:05"" ""Sometimes is is spread across"" ""two strings,"") 
      (""3"" ""00:00:00 --> 00:00:10"" ""but not always.""))
    
    ;; Finish with this, and it's correct
    '((""1"" ""00:00:00 --> 00:00:02"" ""This is some text."") 
      (""2"" ""00:00:02 --> 00:00:05"" ""Sometimes is is spread across two strings,"") 
      (""3"" ""00:00:00 --> 00:00:10"" ""but not always.""))

## The Code

Currently the code does what I want, and to be honest I'm kind of proud of it. It's my real first complicated elisp program. I would like some feedback if you see a better way of doing things, or a place I could improve on.

I wanted to share a fix to a problem I recently had with my spacemacs installation. I had a problem with downloading all and any MELPA/ELPA packages. And this happened out of the blue. The problem, it turns out, was due to authentication keys being outdated. The fix is quite simple. Run this in your Emacs terminal:

    M-x package-install RET gnu-elpa-keyring-update RET

For some reason, Emacs was able to reach the remote repository and install this package (I guess it lives in one of the more default repositories). After this, I restarted my Emacs/Spacemacs instance and the missing packages were successfully downloaded.

Hope this helps someone else. Here is a related link:

Exposing a hook when the chain of commands begins and another when they end.

An example of this is - I might want to increase undo limits to the maximum, while undo/redoing, so there is a guarantee I can get back to the state where I began undoing *(something I miss with undo in Emacs)*.

Or, one could group cursor motion commands, so I could jump back to the point where I started navigating.

This ability to group commands could be generalized so you could define your own groupings for any purpose.

While it does depend on hooks/advice, In my tests - the majority of them are only activated when the gain of commands is being tracked, afterwards they are removed.

[Example test case for undo](https://gitlab.com/snippets/1935389) which could be generalized for user-defined command groupings.

I've started working on an up-to-date package to bring support for the [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org/)'s GDScript language to Emacs. Other available packages all seemed abandoned.

You can find it here: https://github.com/GDQuest/emacs-gdscript-mode

It's already working, with the following features:

- Syntax highlighting
- Code folding
- Imenu
- Support for scenes (.tscn) and script (.gd) files
- Comment wrapping when using fill-paragraph
- Indentation and auto-indentation: tab-based (default) and space-based
- Automatic pairing of parentheses, brackets, etc.

It's based on the core Python support from Emacs 27, as GDScript is based on indents in a similar way.

## Your feedback ##

It's my first emacs package and lisp project, so I'd like to ask the more experienced lisp and emacs package devs here for some insights. 

Unlike in other text editors, it seems that Emacs package developers split their ""plug-ins"" into several packages. For example, in VSCode, there's one Python plugin that brings all sorts of features.p

I've started working on snippets for yas, and would like to generally provide some more features, like evil keybindings where applicable, or functions to open the project in the Godot engine.

Is there a convention, or a guide I could find about the type of features I should write as part of this language-support package?

Also, if you get to try it, I'd appreciate feature requests or indications on possible features to include. Like, I've seen there's a ""semantic"" package for some languages, but I'm not sure what it does exactly, except e.g. add auto-formatting for elisp.

Also, are there some detailed resources or specific packages you'd recommend me to look at to offer a great GDScript language support? So I can read the source code, look at and test available features...

I'd also appreciate code reviews and feedback to help improve the tool. Currently, it's derived from python-mode in Emacs 27. I selectively copied and renamed code from python.el, added some bits here and there... although lisp is an imperative language, and I did look at a code style guide, there are necessarily conventions and functions I'm not aware of.

Why Emacs uses purple?

&#x200B;

According to surveys in Europe and North America, purple is the

color most often associated with rarity, royalty, magic, mystery,

and piety \[Ref 1\].

&#x200B;

rarity   →   Yes, I don't have a friend who uses Emacs.

&#x200B;

royalty  →   Yes, Emacs only do what I mean.

&#x200B;

magic    →   Yes, e.g. Magit.

&#x200B;

mystery  →   Yes, from outside of emacs world.

&#x200B;

piety    →   Yes, we have a church.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Is this the original thought about choosing purple?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I find that candela (cd), one of the seven International System

of Units (SI), use purple, which is interesting.

I've installed emacs but never really tried it. Now I'm looking a way to have calendars, notes and tasks private and secure on my devices which run Linux and Android. I've found out that emacs with org-mode is capable of managing calendars, notes and tasks. I think it would not be a big a problem to set it up on  Linux. On Android I could use Orgzly for the notebooks and tasks, maybe together with Syncthing, but I don't know how I could use the calendars. The solutions I have found so far are org-caldav and somehow syncing with Google Calendar. The thing is, I would like to avoid syncing over my own box over NextCloud, Radicale, etc. and even more over Google Calendar for privacy and security reasons.

So, is there another solution to have all tools (calendars, notes and tasks) play well on Android without sacrificing privacy and security?",1580441929.0

When I cell Helm-Ag and provide a pattern, though, I get ""Searching for program: No such file or directory, ag"". Helm-swoop works, but it only works on open buffers to my knowledge. I'd like the search to happen over all files in the project. Any suggestions?

Computor123,Any tips on a good workflow for python development on a remote machine?,1.0,False,1580346612.0,8,evvu9c,emacs,https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/evvu9c/any_tips_on_a_good_workflow_for_python/,7,"I recently swapped from vim to emacs (doom-emacs). Mainly because I did some testing with magit and org-mode and loved it. When I used vim I tried to create a convoluted folder system + groff to try to do some of what org-mode does, but it just does not come close. But this is besides my point.

&#x200B;

I mostly work with machine learning, this requires me to use remote systems with better compute power than my laptop. Some of these connections can be a bit laggy, so I don't really want to rely on using vim/emacs directly on the remote system. I tried this for a while with vim, but the delay was simply too painful. My old work-flow, was to use sshfs + vim locally on my laptop. Furthermore I would have a buffer which was ssh'd on to the remote machine, and had a ipython session in the correct virtualenv open. Then i would use vim-slime to press ctrl-c+ctrl-c to run the file I was currently editing in the ipython session.

  
I've done some experimenting with tramp, and while it looked promising, I had some issues. Most likely the problem is how I set it up. It was super slow, and it seemed to be because anaconda-mode used the remote virtualenv for things like completion.

&#x200B;

TLDR - My dream setup would be something like this:

\- Use tramp to connect to remote machine.

\- Use a local virtualenv (preferably automatically clone the remote one (for package completion), but this I could do manually or via a script so not important) to run the buffer linting, formatting, completion, etc.

\- Use ctrl-c+ctrl-c to run the code, using a selected virtualenv on the remote machine.

Alternatively how to speedup anaconda-mode when using the python environment on the remote computer. Most of the time this delay is around like 40ms, which should be fine. Seemed like tramp started a new connection for every request ananconda made though.

I'm also not convinced that anaconda-mode is the best choice, so open to other alternatives. I quite liked jedi on vim, and given that the palantir lsp supports jedi, a lsp client would also do just fine.

Any ideas?",1580370955.0

When it comes to swiper tho it seems that for search and find-file it  uses your personal next-line and previous-line global keybindings and  not the default ones. I figured that out cause if I change the  keybindings in my global-map, the keybindings in swiper will also  change!

But when is comes to C-i, it doesn't work! C-k normally goes to the  next-line but C-i doesn't goes to the previous-line! This happens for  both search and find-file. What does the C-i does in swiper and how can I  change that?

P.S. I've also posted this on swiper's github page so don't  get confused if you also saw it there.

**Edit**: It turns out that it wasn't about Swiper but about Ivy!

I’d like to bring up (say) magit-status where its checking the files on the remote .. likewise when you (say) commit I’d like the remote git commands to happen there, on its files. 

It seems like magit is looking for a local git client; even if found (cygwin, or real git in a linux vm on windows host etc), the files would not be there since they’re on the first remote.

Can we tell magit to run the remote git client over the tramp to get its output scrape?

Could probably fake it all using sshfs but that rather defeats using tramp ..

Daangui,Back to cursor's stuttering/choppy movement left-to-right and `garbage-collection`,1.0,False,1580252785.0,6,evdcie,emacs,https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/evdcie/back_to_cursors_stutteringchoppy_movement/,11,"In Reddit there is already some discussion about the relation between emacs's `garbage-collection` and the cursor's *choppy movement* (particularly, the stuttering of the cursor when it moves left/right *and* up/down across headings in large org-mode buffers with plenty of text between headings) [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/55ork0/is_emacs_251_noticeably_slower_than_245_on_windows/)  and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/d46era/troubleshooting_choppy_cursor_movement/).

However, I have not found any conclusion as to what is the optimum equilibrium for setting up the variable `gc-cons-threshold`. Resorting to `(garbage-collect)`, I get these values:

    ((conses 16 2941385 1569658) (symbols 48 108188 1305) (strings 32 507982 93170) (string-bytes 1 17599784) (vectors 16 199557) (vector-slots 8 4175557 614802) (floats 8 2093 8669) (intervals 56 28214 29568) (buffers 992 265))

The value for `string-bytes` is intriguingly high. Doing trial and error I have found out that my cursor responds to input in a way that feels natural by setting   `gc-cons-threshold` to 3000000.

However, take John Wiegley's original setup as an example. In his [init.el](https://github.com/jwiegley/dot-emacs/blob/master/init.el) he has the following settings:

    (setq package-enable-at-startup nil
          file-name-handler-alist nil
          message-log-max 16384
          gc-cons-threshold 402653184
          gc-cons-percentage 0.6
          auto-window-vscroll nil)
    
    (add-hook 'after-init-hook

                       gc-cons-percentage 0.1)
                 (garbage-collect)) t)

Does anyone know of any 'best practice' advice for setting up the garbage collection threshold?

Among other things I did not document, reverting Emacs to version 26 and removing `wc-mode` from the Org hooks seem to have done the trick.

I'm using, as many other here as well, helm as my typical file/content search framework.

Coming from a vim background, I'm very used to the ease of `fzf` using `ag -g` (filepattern seach in `ag`) to find files recursively in the current working directory.

When using `helm-find` it defaults to `find-program` as the program that runs the query. It's default value is `find` which has two major downsides:

- It's quite slow
- Does not support blacklisting (e.g. `.git`, `venv` (python), you name it)

So I've tried to set the `find-program` to `ag -g`:

    (setq find-program ""ag -g"")
    
but when I start `helm-find` and search for something, the result was 

    Find
    /home/xyz/ag: invalid option -- 'e'
    /home/xyz
    /home/xyz/Usage: ag [FILE-TYPE] [OPTIONS] PATTERN [PATH]
    /home/xyz
    /home/xyz/  Recursively search for PATTERN in PATH.
    /home/xyz/  Like grep or ack, but faster.
    /home/xyz
    /home/xyz/Example:
    /home/xyz/  ag -i foo /bar/
    /home/xyz
    /home/xyz/Output Options:
    /home/xyz/     --ackmate            Print results in AckMate-parseable format
    /home/xyz/  -A --after [LINES]      Print lines after match (Default: 2)
    /home/xyz/  -B --before [LINES]     Print lines before match (Default: 2)
    /home/xyz/     --[no]break          Print newlines between matches in different files
    /home/xyz/                          (Enabled by default)
    /home/xyz/  -c --count              Only print the number of matches in each file.
    /home/xyz/                          (This often differs from the number of matching lines)
    /home/xyz/     --[no]color          Print color codes in results (Enabled by default)
    /home/xyz/     --color-line-number  Color codes for line numbers (Default: 1;33)

So it seems that helm is passing some additional flags which clash with ag?

Can anyone help me out here does anyone know a good alternative to get fuzzy recursive (fast) file finding?

It is not hard to test out but it is not automated as a package install as version 8 will be.  We'll allow for about two weeks of feedback and then make the regular wide-scale release.

If you don't know what Hyperbole is, see:

  [https://www.gnu.org/software/hyperbole/](https://www.gnu.org/software/hyperbole/)

Here is what is new:

  [https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/hyperbole.git/tree/HY-NEWS](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/hyperbole.git/tree/HY-NEWS)  


Here are instructions for installation:

If you want to compile Hyperbole yourself you can do it like this:

Move to some path in the filesystem where you want to keep Hyperbole  
and clone the git repository:

  
   git clone [https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/hyperbole.git](https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/hyperbole.git)

cd to the hyperbole folder that was just created. (This is the  
PATH-TO-HYPERBOLE-FOLDER that is mentioned below.)

   cd hyperbole

Byte compile the files:

   make bin

If you prefer to work from the source without byte compiling you can  
instead do:

   make src

Now Hyperbole is prepared on your system but you need to load it to  
your emacs. Edit your ""\~/.emacs"" file and insert the lines:

   (add-to-list 'load-path ""PATH-TO-HYPERBOLE-FOLDER""))  
(load ""hyperbole-autoloads"")  
(load ""hyperbole"")

Restart your emacs or evaluate the lines above in your running emacs  
and you are done.

eyal0,A more beautiful emacs -nw with 24-bit colors and bitmapped fonts,0.96,False,False,58,euscsu,emacs,https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/euscsu/a_more_beautiful_emacs_nw_with_24bit_colors_and/,25,"I found this in various places on the internet, including here, but I thought that I'd put it all on one page.  Maybe it'll help someone?

# Better emacs -nw

## Motivation

* Often I work with `emacs -nw` from home because my internet is slow.
* I want my xterm alternative to have 24-bit color so that I get all the colors
  that emacs in X has.
* I want to click on URLs to open them in my xterm.
* Bitmapped fonts because I think that they look nicer.  I love 6x13.

## Solution

### xfce4-terminal

I was on rxvt but it doesn't support 24-bit colors.  I already use xfce4 so I
wanted to make this one work.  It already does 24-bit color and has clickable
URLs.  I also like that the config is available from the terminal with a
right-click, which saves me a lot of mucking in config files.  The big problem:
**No bitmapped fonts!**

```shell
sudo apt-get install xfce4-terminal
hash -r
```

I found a way to use bitmapped fonts [here](https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1270870):

```shell
cd /etc/fonts/conf.d
ls -l 70-no-bitmaps.conf
# Mine was symlinks to /usr/share/...  YMMV
sudo rm 70-no-bitmaps.conf
# Whatever directory you were symlinked to before, look for 70-yes-bitmaps.conf in there.
sudo ln -s /usr/share/fontconfig/conf.avail/70-yes-bitmaps.conf
sudo dpkg-reconfigure fontconfig
```

I didn't need to reboot X as in the original instructions but maybe you'll need to.

To test, run:

```shell
xfce4-terminal
```

Then right-click on the new terminal, go into Preferences... > Appearances and select the font ""Fixed SemiCondensed"" size 10.  To my eye, it looks just like 6x13!

If you don't want to switch your terminal app, check if it already does 24-bit color [here](https://gist.github.com/XVilka/8346728).  Take note of the delimiter!  It may be colon, semicolon, or both.

### terminfo

Now you need to convince emacs that you have 24-bit color.  If you type:

```shell
echo $TERM
```

You might see something about 256 colors.  The instructions are [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/efaq/Colors-on-a-TTY.html).

Depending on the delimiter that you found earlier, you need to put one of these in your .bashrc or .zshrc (depending on your shell):

```shell
export TERM=xterm-24bit
```

or:

```shell
export TERM=xterm-24bits
```

The latter is the semicolon version.

## Testing

I found the `magit-diff` coloring especially bad in `emacs -nw` .  It's now very readable.  Try moving the cursor around in there and notice that the hunk under the cursor is slightly brighter than the other hunks.",1580179809.0

I had been a vim user for roughly 8 years now. I gave emacs (+evil-mode)  a try and I was quite happy about it. I have a few problems I *really* struggle with though, relative to file names, so I made a list:

## Autocompletion for file names

I would like to have autocomplete for local file names in buffers. For instance, in vim, you can start writing a file name and get suggestions with `C-x C-f`. I have tried a few things:

1. `company-mode` has allegedly auto-completion for file names too, but it never seems to kick in. When I type `./<beginning of file name>`, nothing happens.
2. There is some amount of auto-completion if I press `C-n`, as in vim, but I really don't know where the suggestions come from. Emacs seems to fetch them from some dictionary of English words (?).
3. Right now I am stuck with typing `C-x C-f`, look for the path I want, and try to copy it in the buffer I'm editing. It's not great because the evil-mode keybindings are not available in the buffer where you type the file names (minibuffer? is that how it's called?).

Is there a way to get a list of completions for file names with a keybinding of some sort?

## Helm

When it comes to opening files, one of the reasons I wanted to try Emacs was because of helm, I want to fuzzy-search the name of files, instead of having to remember millions of paths. I've tried `helm-find` and `helm-find-files` and none of them does what I want.

1. `helm-find` works great, but only if the file is in the ""current directory"" of the buffer I'm editing. I haven't found a way to go up in the hierarchy...
2. `helm-find-files` allows to go up on level (with `C-l`, helm is even nice enough to tell it to you), but then, I can't do any fuzzy-searching anymore!

Is there a way to be able to fuzzy-search with any file in the sub-hierarchy *with* the possibility of going up in the hierarchy if you are in the wrong directory?",1580154171.0

Are there any tutorials or test cases for url.el that I could read? In particular, it's clear that url-auth.el supports digest auth. (Yay, I was unable to find that last time I looked.) Simple tests with url-retrieve ask for a username and password, perform digest auth, and return the data. Yay.

However, what I really want is to be able to get the credentials from \~/.authinfo and I find the url.el/url-auth.el code pretty impenetrable. No doubt a consequence of my somewhat meager elisp skills.

It's also not clear to me how url.el expects to have parameters, additional headers, etc. passed to it. I did a little poking about with request.el (which appears to have a more grokable interface) but it relies on curl and passing credentials on the command line introduces a security issue, so I thought I'd take another look at implementing directly on top of url.el.",1580082688.0

I've been using Emacs (currently using [the Scimax setup by John Kitchin](https://github.com/jkitchin/scimax)) for a while now, but I feel like I'm missing an important bit of information about how the program works and what the different layers of commands and programs are.

Specifically, I'm working on writing my CV, and I've tried to use the [Org-CV exporter (by Oscar Najera)](https://github.com/Titan-C/org-cv) to act as the backend to create a PDF. However, since Org-CV hasn't been integrated into the org export dispatch, the documentation calls for running the function `org-export-to-file` as a step in the PDF export process and provides these two commands:

`(org-export-to-file 'moderncv ""moderncv.tex"")`  
`(org-latex-compile ""moderncv.tex"")`

And this is where I'm having trouble. I'll run `M-x org-export-to-file` but there is no available command that matches that description. However, the command `C-h a` is able to find the function and display the documentation. It says that the command `org-export-to-file` is a core function from ox.el, and that it is a Lisp closure. I don't have any idea what that means though and I have no idea how to run these commands.

If you could help me figure out how to implement this function and figure out how to *learn* to use Emacs that would be awesome. That way I can figure these things out on my own in the future.

github-alphapapa,"Speaking as a package maintainer, please do not use MELPA Stable--use regular MELPA",0.94,False,1579910311.0,91,etikbz,emacs,https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/etikbz/speaking_as_a_package_maintainer_please_do_not/,89,"A recent discussion on a mailing list has brought up this issue again.  Here is what I wrote.  Having had this conversation several times before, I think this is as clearly as I can put it.  Please, do not use MELPA Stable.

----

I am led to the conclusion that MELPA Stable needs to be abolished.  I have been a proponent of the idea of MELPA Stable, so I don't say that lightly.

For those who are unaware of the technical issues, here's an explanation.  Briefly:

-   MELPA Stable is nothing like what one might assume it's intended to be like, e.g. Debian Stable or Debian Testing.  It provides none of the benefits that Debian Stable and Testing provide.
-   MELPA Stable is, just like ""regular"" MELPA, a ""rolling"" collection of packages developed without any coordination between maintainers.
-   The only difference is that MELPA Stable contains whatever versions of packages that their maintainers have decided to tag with a version number, rather than the latest commit to the master branch.  These versions are not necessarily better, more stable, more reliable, or more trustworthy than the untagged versions which appear in ""regular"" MELPA.
-   Due to the lack of coordination between dependencies and their APIs, version conflicts and breakage are a regular occurrence.  For example, if package A depends on package B, and package B makes an API change and tags a new MELPA Stable release, users of package A's MELPA Stable version will see package A cease to work properly until package A, not only commits a fix, but tags a new MELPA Stable version containing the fix.  Since packages A and B do not share the same development schedule, it is likely that their tagged-version release schedules will not synchronize well.  
    
    If you are familiar with Debian, imagine if any upstream changes were automatically pushed to Testing despite any freeze that might be in place.  It would be virtually impossible to complete a freeze and make a new stable release, and Testing and Stable would cease to be useful, leaving only Unstable as a usable target.  This is the situation between ""regular"" MELPA and MELPA Stable.

For my packages, I tag stable versions for a few reasons:

-   To help users track changes in the changelog.
-   To help me separate new, possibly bug-introducing changes from working, debugged code.
-   To help packagers in systems like Debian and Guix, who package stable versions of some Elisp packages&#x2013;and who, in so doing, take responsibility for breakage.

Now, I sympathize with not wanting to be vulnerable to potential breakage caused by the uncoordinated release of changes to packages on ""regular"" MELPA.  That is a real problem.  But the solution is not to use MELPA Stable.  The solution is to take charge of what packages you upgrade and when, rather than being at the mercy of whatever commits happen to be in MELPA at the moment.

For myself, I commit the ~/.emacs.d/elpa directory to Git with the rest of my config, and I upgrade packages intentionally.  If breakage happens, I can easily revert and deal with it later.  Other users use alternative package managers, like Borg or Straight or Quelpa, which pull changes directly from Git repos and allow pinning to commits, tags, etc.

So, users, I can only recommend that you abandon MELPA Stable and install packages by other means.  If you don't have the time or inclination to redo your whole config like that, then just use something like Quelpa to install the current version of certain packages directly.  It's a couple lines of use-package in your config, and you can upgrade it manually from then on, e.g. with <https://github.com/alphapapa/unpackaged.el#upgrade-a-quelpa-use-package-forms-package>.  

As always, your Emacs config is up to you.

Now, I'm off to to the discussions on MELPA's tracker to add my vote to abolish MELPA Stable, or to at least allow packages to opt-out of it.",1579937413.0

I run Emacs inside a terminal multiplexer locally, as well as when I'm connected to remote hosts via SSH (""*Yo dawg, I herd you like tmux..."" )* which may seem weird to some, but it's been a part of my professional workflow since back when the epoch was only 9 decimal digits.

When I was lucky enough to be able to run a Linux desktop at work, I used xterm, and things were great. Xterm was the fanciest terminal emulator ever, and you could send it these special 'OSC' (Operating System Command) escape sequences to send data from your terminal to your X clipboard. Over the years, I've had various hacks in my Emacs config to generate these escape sequences to send stuff from my kill-ring to my OS clipboard. Neat! At some point some of this functionality landed in Emacs proper in `xterm.el`. This never really worked for me though, as terminal multiplexers (not to mention nested terminal multiplexers) made this a lot harder, so I ended up maintaining my own code for this.

Over the last holiday break I got serious about improving my Elisp programming skills, and decided to clean up and overhaul my hacks and organize them into a [package on Github](https://github.com/spudlyo/clipetty).

Here it is: [Clipetty](https://github.com/spudlyo/clipetty): Manipulate the system **clip**board in **E**macs from a **TTY**.

Nowadays a [number of really fancy terminal emulators](https://github.com/spudlyo/clipetty#terminals) support Xterm style OSC escape sequences for clipboard manipulation, so I'm hoping this package will be useful for more folks.

I'm using `org-contact` as described on [https://karl-voit.at/2015/02/01/muttfilter/](https://karl-voit.at/2015/02/01/muttfilter/).

     ** First Last                :research:chi09:FirstLast:

So far, I've written those links manually `[[contact:FirstLast]]` just like the tag and not the heading to avoid wrong matches when referring to the name somewhere else.

However, I guess many of you are using a better solution to create such a link. I bet there are many  emacs configurations out there that offer such a function:

Is there somebody who would provide a neat function that is querying the `FirstLast` tags (or from the heading names?) in order to derive the link via ivy/counsel/swiper/helm? This way, I do not have to type in the whole name but would rather get interactive completion for all tags (or names?) used instead.

I do think that for an elisp-savvy person, this does not have to be hard at all...

RidgeRegressor,[Q] Init.el from scratch: Spacemacs-like keybindings,1.0,False,False,3,esju2p,emacs,https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/esju2p/q_initel_from_scratch_spacemacslike_keybindings/,7,"Hey guys,

after getting warm with emacs using spacemacs in the last few months I've finally decided to somewhat start from scratch with my `init.el`. I say somewhat, because the custom part of my spacemacs config was already past 900 lines.

Since I'm a previous vimmer I love evil-mode and mnemonic keybindings for everything that I frequently use. I was impressed by how well spacemacs' keybindings were set up so this is something I want to recreate in my personal setup. Looking at spacemacs' configs, there are a lot of custom spacemacs functions that define keymaps which do all sorts of checks and whatnot. Since I can't really extract the whole keybinding logic from spacemacs', I'm looking for a sane way on how to recreate that experience.

I got in contact with `general.el` which is a bit overwhelming at first but I think it can do what I'm looking for:

- Integration with `which-key.el`
- Define a global `Leader` key (`SPC`) which is accessible everywhere
  - Allow for different prefixes like `SPC w` for `windows` that gives access to further functions (e.g. `SPC w /` for `(split-window-right)`)
  - Allow naming the prefixes, such that, when `SPC` is pressed, the which-key window shows `+windows` instead of `+prefix` (this has probably more to do with `which-key.el` than `general.el`?)
- Define a `Localleader` key (`,`) which is specific to each major-mode

I've played around with `general.el` a bit and got some stuff working:

E.g. this is my implementation of the global `Leader` key (`SPC`):

    (general-define-key
        :states '(normal visual insert emacs)
        :prefix ""SPC""
        :non-normal-prefix ""M-SPC""
        ""/""   'helm-do-ag-project-root
        ""TAB"" 'switch-to-prev-buffer
        ""SPC"" 'helm-M-x
        ""ff""  'helm-find-files
        ""fed"" 'edit-config
        ""feR"" 'reload-config
        ""qq""  'save-buffers-kill-terminal
        ;; Magit

        ""bs""  'switch-to-scratch
        ""bd""  'kill-this-buffer
        ...
        ...)

While this is my implementation of the `Localleader` key (`,`) for the `org-mode-map`:

    (general-define-key
        :keymaps 'org-mode-map
        :states '(normal visual insert emacs)

        ...)

My big question now: Is this the best way to do it?

I've ran into my first issues with the following: I wanted to map `K` during when in `lisp-mode` to `(elisp-slime-nav-describe-elisp-thing-at-point)`

    (general-define-key
        :keymap 'lisp-mode-map  ;; Only in lisp-mode
        :states '(normal)       ;; Only in evil normal-mode
        ""K"" 'elisp-slime-nav-describe-elisp-thing-at-point)

This works when `lisp-mode` is active, but to my surprise, it is now also bound when `lisp-mode` is not active. `C-h k K` shows `elisp-slime-nav-describe-elisp-thing-at-point` in any other major-mode as well, even though I explicitly specified `:keymap 'lisp-mode-map` in `(general-define-key ...)`. Without the above mapping `K` defaults to `evil.el`'s `evil-lookup` function which I want to keep for all other major-modes (for now). What am I doing wrong here?

I've been using exwm in Spacemacs for a while now using the [https://github.com/timor/spacemacsOS](https://github.com/timor/spacemacsOS) layer. Since I am not an Emacs pro I am not sure weather my lies within that Spacemacs layer or exwm itself. But maybe someone has made similar experiences and can help me.

Lets get to the issue: exwm works just as intended until I make a keystroke of some certain keys (for example: ß or § as well as the laptop function keys on my F-keys order media keys). As soon as one of those keys is pressed emacs freezes and I have to kill it within another tty. This obviously gets very frustrating, especially since ß is a character in the German (my native language) alphabet so my system crashes while i just type some text. I did set the emacs input language to german, but that did not help.

Maybe I need to configure something in order to get those keys to work? If anyone can guide me in the right direction I'd be really thankful.

Thanks to everyone trying to help!

I am grateful for the journey -- it's taught me a lot about what I want in an editor, and really in an interface to a computer. But lately, I've been noticing myself getting increasingly disappointed and frustrated with my day-to-day experience, and daydreaming about alternatives. I'm posting for two reasons:

1. I'd love to have feedback on my init file, to see if there's anything I'm doing wrong, or have failed to understand about how Emacs works, or should be configured.

2. To get feedback on some growing misgivings about Emacs' software design.

My main problem today is that too many things feel broken. I have strange issues with inconsistent theming, sporadic lag, undo which suddenly stops working (even without undo-tree), packages that don't seem to activate (flyspell, pyim), variables whose values change unexpectedly, modes which seem to get enabled/disabled for no reason -- the list goes on.

I'm also having difficulty configuring Emacs to do what I want; e.g.: company-mode seems to work in Emacs Lisp mode and go-mode, but not in org-mode. I want to set a 72 character auto-fill for magit commit messages, but my attempts either don't work or set auto-fill everywhere.

Another issue is that functionality seems to change quickly. Variables get deprecated, functions no longer behave the same way. E.g. -- I used to be able to insert capture templates directly into org-mode, then with the latest release, the capture buffer always pops up. The maintenance cost of keeping Emacs consistent is, by my standards, high.

There are hours where Emacs seems to work fine. But almost every day, I'm running into erratic behavior and frustration. It's puzzling -- when I started using Emacs, I was blindly copying configs and using customize. I installed every neat package I came across. Emacs was a little buggy, but I attributed it to being a beginner with a messy config file.

Years later, and I've pared down the list of packages. I don't really know Emacs Lisp, but I completed the exercism track and can at least parse the syntax. I refactored to use use-package (which maybe was a mistake); my config is now under 1200 lines. And yet, if anything, Emacs feels more broken than before.

Here's my init: https://github.com/dwrz/config/blob/master/emacs/init.el. I'd love any kind of feedback on it, large or small. But I'm particularly wondering if there's anything which I'm obviously not grokking, or worse, fundamentally misunderstood. I'm also wondering if it's evident that my lack of Emacs Lisp knowledge is holding me back -- though I'm not sure how I feel now about the prerequisite of proficiency in a language for proper configuration.

I know that, even beyond my lack of ability to properly configure Emacs, I'm responsible for the current situation. I haven't filed bug reports, either with Emacs or with package maintainers. I haven't consistently bisected my config to try to gain clarity as to what might be going on.

But I do want to push back on that a little bit. Some of the behavior I've come across is erratic. It's not reproducible, at least apparently, there isn't a consistent cause. Sometimes things work fine, sometimes things are broken. I have personally never managed to find a config or package bug by bisecting or profiling. If I can't catch it with flycheck or by reviewing the code, I'm usually stuck.

I also don't want to spend hours tweaking and debugging my configuration. I use i3 as my window manager. I touched its configuration a few times a year at most, and after the initial setup, I've largely left it alone. Emacs, by comparison, is starting to feel like the trope of the antique racecar that needs constant maintenance.

I'm now at a point where I'm wondering if the price of stability is reduced configurability, and whether an editor running on an interpreter is really such a good idea. I played around with some of the suckless tooling, and while it's more bare than I'd like, at this point the idea of letting a compiler check configuration is appealing.

I feel like I'm at a crossroads: either I manage to make Emacs more fluid, or I will probably try to slowly transition functionality out of Emacs, either by switching tooling or writing my own replacements for functionality.

Again, I don't regret the journey. If I ever had the time and ability to write my own editor/system-interface, I'd steal many ideas from Emacs. Window management, plain text storage (org-mode, ledger), dired, hydras, the daemon, use via terminal and X11, ivy, counsel, hippie-expand, yasnippet, magit, built-in documentation. It's even more amazing, I'd say inspiring, that all this is the result of a community's work. There have been a lot of lessons, which I am still grateful for.

But I am starting to wonder if I want to continue down this road. There are competing priorities and aspirations in my life, and, to use the analogy of the car again, I want to be driving to and seeing places, without tweaking and repairing the vehicle every week.",1579701628.0

Recently - a month or so ago - I was convinced into trying emacs for the first time in my life. It was something of a bet among my colleagues, how long I would last before givng up. So I was more goaded than convinced maybe. My first mistake was falling into this obvious trap.

Anyway, one of the guys at work uses emacs for apparently everything from editing to irc to ""org mode"" - which is something I don't really understand what it is yet. He's very enthusiastic about ""spreading the love"", so to speak, and sent me his emacs configuration as a starting point. This was my second mistake.

As for myself, I've mostly used editors like Atom/Sublime, and IDEs like vscode. When I am not ashamed I sometimes admit to having used Eclipse one time. Before this whole thing happened, I was using vscode, and was happy about most things, except maybe the performance being pretty bad in large projects.

So for the last month I have been stubbornly removing weird or redundant plugins (packages, I guess they are called) and trying to sanitise the settings and keybindings in this... configuration... that I received. I've now arrived at something that's semi-useable for daily use, even though I tend to forget the keybindings constantly and end up using M-x and then trying to remember the name of the command I'm after. Works well enough, and not that different from what I often had to do with vscode.

This however leads me to what I call ""the emacs loop"". I humbly request your help in trying to break out of it and relieve my frustration. Let me explain with an example.

For instance, I've been using magit. Good for viewing diffs and whatnot. So when I feel remotely confident in using it, I start to recall the tools I used to have - in this case GitLens, with the amazingly useful inline git blame per line, in the background of the document, on the line the cursor is on. And I try to emulate this in emacs. After two days of google and fumbling around with lisp, I end up in a situation where I can get something that's sort of similar to what I'm after, but worse, along with a promise that if I spend enough time wrestling with lisp I can get even closer to what I want, though never the whole way, most often because of some archaic limitation in the emacs design. So I end up frustrated, even though the tool I have is sort of functional. Then I swallow my frustration, and find the next thing that works worse than I expected it to.

This happens over and over again. With inline git blame, actual scrolling where the cursor can end up off-screen, gdb integration that actually works consistently, tabs that do what you expect when you click or drag them, multiple lines of information displayed constantly (in the ""mode line""), line width indication that doesn't cause horizontal scrolling bugs, and so on. The answer I end up finding every time is ""that's not the emacs way"" or ""that needs changes in the C code"".

I want to not be frustrated. Am I looking at this wrong? Should I try adapting the way I work and the way I expect my tools to work to emacs, rather than the other way around? How have you fine people dealt with the issue where emacs is just so... different from everything else you have ever used, and feels so limited?

I apologise for how whiney this sounds, but I find myself at a loss. I expected emacs to be just another IDE like the others with some quirks, but I didn't expect every single thing to be completely different from all of them. Does everyone run into this wall?",1579664792.0

The Japanese term /satori/ refers to the experience of enlightenment, the realisation of how things really are that is the primary aim of practice and meditation. However, the Zen tradition is famous for claiming that one cannot say what it is that one realises, that is, one cannot articulate the content of the enlightenment experience. Although it makes everything clear, it is an experience beyond words. Instead of being given an explanation of how things are, the student of Zen hears sayings called /koan/, often somewhat paradoxical in character, that come from those who are enlightened:

* “There are no CTRL and META.”
* “If you meet an Emacs you dislike, kill it.”
* “No one knows Emacs.”
* “One can only learn Emacs by living within it.”
* “To know Org mode is to know oneself.”

It is important to realise that /koan/ are intended to move you off of one path and onto another. They are not just attempts to mystify you.

It allows you to interactively search & clone GitHub projects, until I implement support for other forges (Gitlab requires a private API key which I will look into soon).

It uses `ivy-read` to allow for the async lookup as you type, and `request` to do the API talking. There is a _lot_ of room for improvement (I'm not exactly fluent in Elisp)(yet), but I'm very happy I managed to pull off the basic functionality. Emacs shines best when developing from within, and that was my first glimpse of it.

,"Installing emacs on WSL2 with Windows, but it works",1.0,False,1579578181.0,20,er248t,emacs,https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/er248t/installing_emacs_on_wsl2_with_windows_but_it_works/,27,"Hi everyone, I've spent a good two hours setting up emacs with WSL2 on Windows and I suppose some people might benefit from it because no guide I could find was that straightforward, here it goes :

How to install Emacs on Windows 10 with WSL 2, as of Jan 2020, this starts from a blank slate.

First, make sure that you have the proper version of Windows 10 and follow [this link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl2-install). Don't forget to check that you've enabled WSL2 before installing your Linux distro.

I ran into a fragmented disk error, fixed by following this [github issue](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4103).

Once WSL is installed, I launch it and it prompts for a username and password, I oblige. That password is your sudo passwd, if you want to setup a user account instead, [see here](https://github.com/hubisan/emacs-wsl#user).

The current version is Ubuntu 18.04 LTS but I'd like the latest version you'll probably want to keep the LTS version but if you wanted to change it :

	 sudo nano /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades

and convert `lts` to `normal`. Save the modified file and close it, then type this in the regular prompt : `do-release-upgrade`.
Since the default version is LTS, you might have to update the distro *two* times, patience is a virtue. You'll be prompted to reboot your system (aka Windows) at some point, do so.

I ran into another issue, where the updater complains about ``lxd`` and ``snap``. I followed [this issue](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/3664) which seems to be only a band aid for now. Once the problem is settled, update && upgrade.
Said issue is not fixed yet and [can be followed here](https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/windows-subsystem-for-linux/216/27).

This might take a while so, we can focus on providing a GUI for emacs in the mean time.

Let's [download VcXsrv](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/) to provide the GUI, install it ; launch it and accept the default setup, upon reaching the **extra settings**, complete it with the last box ticked as well, [like this](https://imgur.com/a/CV3IZVA). I know it's not super safe. This allows WSL2 to connect properly though, per [this issue](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4106) and [this github](https://github.com/hubisan/emacs-wsl#configure-wsl).
Note that you'll have to add the ``export DISPLAY=$(cat /etc/resolv.conf | grep nameserver | awk '{print $2}'):0`` (or some variant of it), to your `.bashrc`, to have WSL2 find the proper display.
If you want to explore the available commands of VcXsrv, you can look them up [here](https://gist.github.com/stowler/9921780). 

Finally, the installer will prompt you for a place to save the config file. Save that config file to  :

     C:\Users\<YourName>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup 

where you replace ``<YourName>`` with your user name ; this will launch the X server at startup and you won't have to think about it. Alternatively, just keep it as is on your desktop and launch it from the desktop itself when you need it.

Once both updates and X server are set, we can finally download emacs proper, you might have to install some additional libraries as WSL is pretty bare, see [here](https://github.com/hubisan/emacs-wsl#install-emacs), if you need ``pdf-tools``, don't forget to dl the [prerequisites](https://github.com/politza/pdf-tools#server-prerequisites). Now, ``sudo apt install emacs`` should work alright.

If you end up with a blurry screen or blurred images, you can look up [this question](https://superuser.com/questions/1370361/blurry-fonts-on-using-windows-default-scaling-with-wsl-gui-applications-hidpi) which worked for me.

For setting default directories and paths, you'll need to have them respect the following synthax : 

     C:\Users\ME\Documents (Windows) ==> /mnt/c/Users/ME/Documents (WSL)

First, here's what you would type:

    It's natural to decompose large problems,
    #+begin_src haskell :noweb-ref defn-of-f :tangle no
    f = h ∘ g
    #+end_src
    But we need to define $g$ and $h$ /beforehand/ before we can use them. 
    Yet it's natural to “motivate” their definitions 
    ---rather than pull a rabbit out of hat. Org-let's us do that!  Here's one,
    
    #+begin_src haskell :noweb-ref code-from-other-places :tangle no
    g = ⋯
    #+end_src
    
    then the other.
    #+begin_src haskell :noweb-ref code-from-other-places :tangle no
    h = ⋯
    #+end_src
    
    Of-course, we might also want a preamble:
    #+BEGIN_SRC haskell :tangle myprogram.hs
    import ⋯
    #+END_SRC
    
    We can now weave in the tagged code blocks in the order we want.
    #+BEGIN_SRC haskell :tangle myprogram.hs :comments none :noweb yes
    <<code-from-other-places>>
    <<defn-of-f>>
    #+END_SRC

Now `C-c C-v C-t` yields a file named `myprogram.hs` with contents in an order amicable to a machine.

    import ⋯
    
    g = ⋯
    h = ⋯
    f = h ∘ g

2. to install org-bullets. the org-bullets github said to include this line:  
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook (lambda () (org-bullets-mode 1)))  
but if i'm using use-package, i can just do this instead right?  
:hook (org-mode . org-bullets-mode)  
in this case use-package's :hook simply means that we're adding in a new function, the org-bullets-mode function for the existing org-mode?  But can someone explain the original line to me maybe? (add-hook 'org-mode-hook (lambda () (org-bullets-mode 1)))    
what exactly is this lambda () ? I did a M-x describe function, but I'm completely new to emacs and lisp so I didn't quite understand it fully :(",1579475387.0

Here's a short example that illustrates both:

    (doct '((:symbolic-parent

             :template-file ""~/templates/""
             :children ((""One"" :keys ""1""

                         :+template-file ""two.txt"")))))

If a parent form's name is a symbol (I chose "":symbolic-parent"" here for illustrative purposes, but in practice any symbol will do), it is not included in the translated list of templates.
This allows one to share inherited properties between groups of parents.

Certain keywords can add to their inherited values with the use of the "":+KEYWORD"" syntax.
In the above example, the `:+template-file` values are joined with the inhertied `:template-file` value.

Running the above, doct returns:

    ((""1"" ""One"" entry (file """") (file ""~/templates/one.txt""))
     (""2"" ""Two"" entry (file """") (file ""~/templates/two.txt"")))

I'm in the middle of a complete, optimized rewrite of doct now that I've got the API figured out.
Just wanted to put these features out there to see what people think.

The most common being org mode so far and capturing templates. Here is [my progress so far](https://github.com/codygman/doom-emacs-literate-config/blob/master/config.org) which I'm attempting to add to only as needed. I feel like I can keep the most important things organized at the top and have another ""Less Frequently Needed Workflows"" section.

A lot of it was inspired by [lifemacs](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/eiqwh6/lifemacs_a_life_configuring_emacs/) which I think does a good job of this.

If you have any other examples of this sort of ""describe workflow first, code is an implementation detail"" type of literate emacs configuration please share!

I originally started out using org only to organize sections of my config stuck thinking in the way the computer cares about the code with structure like:

    * Packages
    ** Org Mode
    ** Haskell Mode
    ** Magit

But that format doesn't really get at the reason why the configuration code exists. It's not bad, but I think we can do better. I instead envision something like:

    * Workflows
    ** Managing Life With Org Mode
    *** Capturing
    ** Developing Haskell
    *** Haskell Web Development
    **** Common Haskell Web Dev Task 1
    * Less Common Workflows
    ** Order Pizza In Emacs
    * Weave Everything Together for the machine
    ** Install Use Package
    ** Install Haskell
    ** Configure Org Mode

Thoughts on this? I feel like most of our configurations are noise and we lose their reason why. It feels like literate programming and org babel can help liberate us from that if we go far enough and fully embrace the paradigm.

When is it useful to have code inline with the prose of workflows? When do you make a link to `Configure Org Mode -> Capture Template -> Simple Todos` vs inlining the simple todo capture template in place and weaving it in for the machine later?

I had some other notes I typed up on this subject and I'll try to edit those in later, but I wanted to get this out there and see what others are thinking on the subject.",1579405312.0

As I install packages with `package-install`, the `package-selected-packages` list gets populated so that I can quickly restore my packages with `package-install-selected-packages`. This is very handy; however, I would like some of my packages to be installed only on Linux, or only on Windows. I'm having a hard time going about solving this problem.

As an example, I want the `pinentry` package to be installed only on Linux so what I tried to do is to install it normally so that it ended up in the `package-selected-packages` list and I added this Elisp snippet in my `init.el`:

    (when (memq system-type '(windows-nt ms-dos))
      (delete 'pinentry package-selected-packages))

but for some reason it doesn't work. The `package-selected-packages` list remains unmodified.

Finally, I know I could simply install all packages on both operating systems and then selectively load them during the init process but ideally I would like to install only what I need, if that's possible.

However, the moment I try to use them on non-trivial projects (hundreds of thousands of lines of code, more complicated code, etc), that's when everything quite literally blows up. Clangd is utterly hopeless and can't even find headers that plainly exist in the compile_commands file. On the flip side, clang crashes when trying to index certain files for CCLS for reasons that elude me. Rtags has deficiencies which was what brought about the LSP in the first place (hanging the editor seems to be the problem I run into the most).

From the question, I got some leads to NLP packages. I wonder if there's any lighter way solution.

Thanks for the pointers for CoreNLP, and NLTK!

I would like a lighter solution for my following requirements:

Convert one line of text (paragraph) in space indented lines of a text, such that

1. for the beginning line of a sentence text terminates by a period "". "", or question mark ""? "" or exclamation mark ""! "", have one space indent
2. for the phrase separated by a comma "", "",  semicolon ""; "", or double column "": "", have one additional indent relative its current line's indent,
3. for annotation text tagged by a pair of ""\["" and ""\]"", one more indent space relative to the internet level of its current line and become one line of its own.
4. For punctuations inside annotation, they should be ignored for indent level treatment.

Here is an example:

The raw paragraph text:

`3 Behind the second curtain was a ·room [section; L tent] called the ·Most Holy Place [T Holy of Holies;` [`Ex. 26:31–34`](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exod.26.31-Exod.26.34&version=EXB)`]. 4 In it was a golden altar for burning incense [`[`Lev. 16:12–13`](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lev.16.12-Lev.16.13&version=EXB)`] and the ·Ark [box; chest] ·that held the old agreement [L of the covenant/contract;` [`Ex. 25:10`](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exod.25.10&version=EXB)`;` [`26:33`](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exod.26.33&version=EXB)`], covered [L completely; on all sides] with gold. Inside this Ark was a golden jar of manna [`[`Ex. 16:33–34`](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exod.16.33-Exod.16.34&version=EXB)`], Aaron’s rod that once grew leaves [`[`Num. 17:1–11`](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Num.17.1-Num.17.11&version=EXB)`], and the stone tablets of the ·old agreement [covenant; contract;` [`Ex. 25:16`](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exod.25.16&version=EXB)`;` [`40:20`](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exod.40.20&version=EXB)`;` [`Deut. 10:2`](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deut.10.2&version=EXB)`].`

The transformed:

`3 Behind the second curtain was a ·room`

`[section; L tent]`

`called the ·Most Holy Place`

`[T Holy of Holies; Ex. 26:3134].`

`4 In it was a golden altar for burning incense`

`and the ·Ark`

`[box; chest]`

`·that held the old agreement`

`[L of the covenant/contract; Ex. 25:10; 26:33],`

`covered`

`[L completely; on all sides]`

`with gold.`

`Inside this Ark was a golden jar of manna`

`[Ex. 16:3334],`

`Aaron’s rod that once grew leaves`

`[Num. 17:111],`

`and the stone tablets of the ·old agreement`

`[covenant; contract; Ex. 25:16; 40:20; Deut. 10:2].`

You might wonder why I want to have this format of a paragraph because this can be rendered into a nice mind-map structure with Freeplain, a software of Mind Map,

Without considering escaping the segmentation rules of the punctuation inside the annotation. The solution might be simply splitting text by punctuations, and then concatenate segments with a proper number of indent spaces or newline.

I would like to seek examples, in Emacs Lisp, Python, Clojure, or Java, helpful to implement the requirements, lighter than using those NLP packages.

Thanks again!

Is there a way to print `lsp-logs` or `lsp-workspace-show-log` to a file in workspace or project root?

I have seen in older documentation that `lsp-print-io` can do that , but looks like the function is deprecated from version 6.1 with `lsp-log-io` and it just print the log to \*lsp-log\* buffer .

Any help is much appreciated. Thanks",1579316702.0

I am using org-mode to track my work progress on tasks. Sometimes my workflow is focused pomodoro-like periods (happens when I know exactly what should I do), sometimes it is multiple conversations tracking between tasks with context switches. At the end of the day I'd like to recap and write summary on my tasks progress during the day.

I wonder how I can organize my work better with org mode. RN I am using org-journal to write some notes and drafts and to use org-mode as my rubber duck to solve some problems. At the end of the day I manually squash journal entries to the corresponding tasks, generate effort report of the day and write summary. Next day org-journal automatically refiles tasks that I didn't close.

But what I really want is to some way to automate some routine. 

- I want to be prompted to write a journal entry about task each time I clock in and clock out, just like in pomodoro technique.
- I want some way to not to loose information about the order of journal entries. Ideally, it would be good to be able to switch between two views: one is chronological, which is good for recapping and reflection, and other is task-related, which is good for actually solving the task, observing all of the info at once.

Even with projectile option, I am still able to go to the buffers that are not segregated.

Example:

Workspace 1: abc.org abcdef.org (config files)
Workspace 2: xyz.org wxyz.org (non-config files )

* File compression (optional, on by default).
* Quiet warnings (checkdoc, byte-code compiling, enable lexical scoping).

I was wondering if i can do anything to fix this. I dont get any errors with `toggle-debug-on-error` or even messages in the `*messages*` buffer suggesting what could be happening, so im clueless as how to fix this.",1579053085.0
MadStranger,Calendar highlight,1.0,False,False,3,eon7j4,emacs,https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/eon7j4/calendar_highlight/,2,"Hi.

I'm trying to setup the events in the default emacs calendar. Is there a way to make different types events be highlighted with different colours? The best would be to be able to define colours for different source files or categories.

Thanks in advance!

The setup:

First, I created the files for the events.  
`Birthdays and anniversaries -*- mode: org; mode: visual-line -*-`  
`*Test`  
`:PROPERTIES:`  
`:CATEGORY: Birthday`  
`:END:`  
`%%(org-anniversary 1990 01 01) Some random guy (%d)`

Second, I created diary file and added the line to transfer the events:  
`%%(org-diary) ~/agenda_friends.org`

Now I enter the M+x calendar and after pressing the ""m"" for markdown I do see the event. The events from the default holiday calendar are marked different when you turn them on, so is there a chance I can customize it for my files?",1579046727.0

A restart of Emacs fixes it for a while but it always seems to creep up again and I'm not sure what's causing it. At first I thought it was a problem with me adding an org link type using `(org-link-set-parameters)` in my init.However, I removed that bit of code (and restarted it after) and the problem has occurred once again.

&#x200B;

The problem looks something like this:

A link that is formatted like this: `[[`[`https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/`](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)`][Emacs Link]]` that should show up as [Emacs Link](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) ends up showing up as [//www.gnu.org/software/emacs/](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/).

When I run `(org-open-at-point)` on the link, it opens an empty browser tab - and when I run `(org-insert-link)` which would normally open the link for me to edit in the minibuffer, I'm presented with ""Link: https:"" in the minibuffer and then the rest of the link shows up as the description. I'm just sure this has something to do with my config. However, I've also checked many times and I can't see anything that would affect the variables that hold reg expressions for link identification and searching (which I've looked through and still don't see any problems with).

Could anyone give me pointers on how to debug this one? I'm not sure what to do and this is definitely the worst problem I've ever run into (though I've no doubt I'll solve it eventually...).

Thanks in advance!

2. I've found what triggers it! I don't know why nor have I found a solution, but it seems that whenever I save my [init.org](https://init.org) file (I use a literate config) and it compiles, it breaks org link parsing. I shall keep exploring...

At my work, we write a fair bit of [LitElement](https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/). For those unfamiliar, it is an offshoot of the Polymer project, providing a framework with more modern features for writing standard Web Components using lit-html.

One feature of this framework are [html](https://lit-html.polymer-project.org/api/modules/lit_html.html#html) and [css](https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/guide/styles) template literals.

So for those who didn't know, [SES](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/ses.html). It's fairly simple, but there are a few things I would like to try and add on to it.

1. Insert links

  At the moment, you can insert strings of text, numbers, or a s-expression for calculations. It'd be nice to put links, like in Org Mode, instead of just a url.

2. Copy contents of singular cells

  Unless it's been hidden from me, you can't just copy a singular cell. You can mark rows and columns, and copy those, but you can't just copy a cells content.

3. Exporting SES files to CSV.

  This isn't a request for help but more of something helpful I found There is a script called `ses2any` on [the wikipage](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SimpleEmacsSpreadsheet), but if you have some preference to use Python3, I *""fixed""* it [for Python3](https://hastebin.com/exabofific.py) (I changed like...4 things lol) to work for Python 3. However this uses [xlwt](https://github.com/python-excel/xlwt) not the [xlsxwriter module](https://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io/) (which I'm pretty sure is just some FFI binding to [libxlsxwriter](https://libxlsxwriter.github.io/)) so if you want an Excel file you'll be getting older versions of Excel files. And if you abstain from Python altogether (I'm not a Python fan myself), or you're just not comfortable copypasting code from the internet (what is StackOverflow :S, jokes aside understandable) hopefully that gives you an idea of what to do.

Anyway, I hope some people are interested in extending SES.",1578920862.0

I have been thinking why It is just loads appearance and then shows the gui. I search it on the internet. I accidentally noticed that emacs 27 comes additional init process which is before the loading gui.

So If you move these following settings on your **init el** to **early-init.el**, your startup will look more robust and faster.

    (tool-bar-mode -1)
    (scroll-bar-mode -1)

I calculate the startup speed with `time emacs --eval '(kill-emacs)'` it reduces my startup **1.163** sec to **0.946** sec. I think creating and destroying the menu-bars and some other things gets so much time and it is so unnecessary process.

The configuration of the early-init.el is tricky. For instance (blink-cursor-mode -1) doesn't work or maximized screen settings works but some bugs happening on the corners coloring.

I accidentally find the early-init.el and when I search it on google, I get nearly nothing. So I want to share it with you.

(I wish it were integrated with project.el better though - but that's a story for another day.) However, even with Projectile I could not cover my use case completely, which is that of having a single C++ source tree and multiple build configurations in separate out-of-tree directories. I thought that was too common a use case to be not covered by published Emacs packages, but so far it seems that only [https://github.com/rpav/cmake-build.el](https://github.com/rpav/cmake-build.el) handles it. It is not available in the common package repos, I git submodule'd it into my dotfiles and I gave its only second GitHub star, which is surprising and perhaps my advertising here won't hurt.

I am trying it right now and am mostly happy. It is not without drawbacks though: the compilation buffer is in Shell not Compilation mode so no M-x compilation-next-error etc, its integration with Projectile is only for getting the project root, and so Projectile configure/make/test commands will not work, I still need to think through the keybindings for M-x cmake-build-clear-cache-and-configure and friends etc.

I'm posting here in the hope that someone has hit the same problem and found a solution/work-around/whatever.

When I open a C++ file, lsp-mode starts a clangd server process. (I'm using clangd 9.0.1, but the same happened with previous versions.) Sometimes (not always), clangd apparently starts indexing my project and launches a bunch of threads. Each of these threads consumes an insane amount of memory. If I'm not quick enough and kill clangd, the machine becomes completely unusable within ten seconds. The fastest way to recover is to power-cycle. Passing a -j parameter reduces the number of threads, but the amount of allocated memory still grows to absurd amounts.

My current ""solution"" is a shell script wrapper with `ulimit -v 2000000` at the beginning. This makes clangd die quickly maybe a hundred times until it stops crashing and everything works fine again. It almost looks like it gets some of the indexing done before hitting my 2GB memory limit and finally completes its job after enough restarts.

But. I haven't added any extra parameters to the clangd command, and the defaults used by lsp-mode seem to be empty. Therefore, clangd should not be passed the `--background-index` option, which could explain this behavior. I'm puzzled.

Needless to say, my ""solution"" is a terrible and annoying hack I'd like to avoid. Any suggestions or pointers for further research?",1578625205.0
nv-elisp,[ANN/RFC] DOCT: Declarative Org Capture Templates new features,0.95,False,1578593070.0,14,emcmi0,emacs,https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/emcmi0/annrfc_doct_declarative_org_capture_templates_new/,6,"I've added a couple of [features](https://github.com/progfolio/doct/tree/feature-additive-keywords) I've always wanted in org capture templates to [doct](https://github.com/progfolio/doct).  




I'll  explain these with an example template from my config:

    (""Note""
     :keys ""n""
     :file (lambda () (let ((file (concat default-directory ""notes.org"")))
                        ;;create if doesn't exist
                        (set-buffer (find-file-noselect file t t))
                        (write-file file) file))
     :template (lambda () (if (y-or-n-p ""link?"")
                              ""* %doct:todo-state %A""
                            ""* %doct:todo-state %?""))
     :todo-state ""TODO""
     :children ((""bug"" :keys ""b""
                 :headline ""Bugs :bug:"")
                (""enhancement"" :keys ""e""
                 :headline ""Ehnancements :enhancement:""
                 :todo-state ""IDEA"")
                (""feature"" :keys ""f""
                 :headline ""Features :feature:""
                 :todo-state ""IDEA"")
                (""optimization"" :keys ""o""
                 :headline ""Optimizations :optimization:"")
                (""security"" :keys ""s""
                 :headline ""Security :security:"")))






This is a capture template I use to take notes while developing a project. It allows me to capture categorized ideas about a program in a directory local ""notes.org"" file. The headlines can optionally link back to the source code that prompted them.   

 
Doct's syntax makes the parent/child relationship between templates explicit using the `:children` keyword.
Each child template inherits properties from its parent. Inherited properties are overridden by declaring the property directly on the child.
In this instance, each ""Note"" child uses the same function to find its target file. They also use the same template function.


The template function returns a template string which uses another new doct feature: the `%doct` escape sequence.
Any keyword that isn't a recognized doct keyword gets added to the org-capture-plist inside the `doct-options` plist.
This allows one to specify custom template metadata without polluting the org-capture-plist.
The `%doct` escape sequence is syntatic sugar for embedding custom metadata into the template string.
In the example, the inherited template function returns a template's `:todo-state` property.
The ""ehancement"" and ""feature"" children override the inherited value of ""TODO"" with ""IDEA"".


I have more features on the way and am working on optimizing performance.
Any suggestions, comments, criticisms are welcome.

,Elisp for Resizing Windows,0.6,False,False,1,em111j,emacs,https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/em111j/elisp_for_resizing_windows/,7,"I recently got a substantially larger monitor, and, whereas, a single, equally-sized, c-x 3 split screen used to be adequate 90% of the time, I now want more.

Consulting the physical manual (p 171) told me how to do it, but it takes forever to keep typing c-x {, for example, or even c-x z.  Searching around, [this](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GrowShrinkWindows) seemed to be the least confusing way I found to go about it (code pasted at end for convenience).

Not knowing elisp, and wanting to keep my init.el file understandable to me, I would like to make sure there's not a more simple way, or, baring that, understand what the below code is doing, and if it's still valid for Emacs 25/26.

It seems to me it's remapping the keys to c-x \[ (which is easier than having to hit shift), and allowing me to interactively shrink and/or enlarge windows with an argument (like M-5 C-n does) or by 5 if there's no argument, which I also assume I could change.

`(defun xor (b1 b2)`

`""Exclusive or of its two arguments.""`

`(or (and b1 b2)`

`(and (not b1) (not b2))))`

`t, then move left, otherwise move right.""`

I have been transitioning to mu4e+org-mode lately to manage my email and when mu4e loads Emacs crashes.

My problem started as follows, initially when i was opening All unread emails in mu4e (bu keybind) and pressing `Ctrl + down arrow key` in the buffer Emacs crashed instantly. I ignored this behavior as i did not use it usually so it didn't have impact on my workflow. The last couple of days though whenever i load mu4e, Emacs crashes in a matter of seconds which seems pretty weird to me.

Below you can find attached the stacktrace that is being generated when mu4e is loaded. I have never seen Emacs crash and from the little things i understand this crash must be system related.  What i have figured out is that Emacs crashes when an emoji needs to be displayed because when i enable mu4e-alert(libnotify), Emacs does not crash instantly after loading mu4e although disabling leads to instant crashes.With mu4e-alert enabled the `Ctrl + down arrow key` crash still happens. You can find my init.el [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/innerout/Emacs/master/init.el). I won't post my mu4e-config for now as i have to remove many personal info but if you think it is needed i will clean it and upload it.

Edit: By following the instructions in comments i built Emacs 27 and 28 with cairo and crashes stopped happening.

Hi all,

I've been quite a while configuring emacs under Linux and keyboard shortcuts to my needs. It works fantastic on the GUI.

However, when it is about the CLI the situation changes. For instance, I have a keybinding for F9, but when I press it on the CLI the scratch outputs a mere ""[20~"". I tried some time ago many many links from emacswiki (LinuxConsoleKeys) / stackexchange and others with no luck, as emacs behavior remains just outputting that string. This happens on a terminal under X, and also on a single tty.

It is a bit upsetting to me, since other CLI editors (like nano) work out of the box for those keys. I use zsh as shell, fwiw.

One could argue: ""don't use CLI and stick to the GUI, as it is just fine"". But I'm working on this since I was about to start using emacs on termux, and I guess I'll face the same problem.

I think org-mode is a powerful tool in Emacs and very versatile and I know a great many people have benefited from it. I just started looking into it for past few weeks. My POV is from a user rather than a developer as I haven't dug deep into the source code yet. As I learn more I am more and more perplexed by the input and output data structure and overall organization. Org-mode has a syntax which seems stricter than something like markdown but definitely not as strict as xml for example. Most of the data such as tags, properties etc. are stored as text by sprinkling them around the headlines using a loose syntax . This setup seems very fragile (and probably also inefficient). If there is slight typo or difference in the way an editor handles the org files (automatic indentation or line wrapping for example) it can completely mess up the parsing (please correct me if I am wrong). The user interface allows both entering things through keybindings/commands and also just plain typing and copy/pasting. Also, there are many instances (such as links) where one can execute arbitrary shell and Elisp commands by clicking on it which seems to me a security hole. So I guess my main questions are: 

* Is there a way to ensure integrity of the org files and prevent messing up the structure syntax? It seems to me that things like TODO, tags, time stamps should only be allowed through keybindings and not by typing or copy-paste which can lead to errors.
* How efficient is this setup of TODOs, tags, properties etc. scattered over many different files all over the system? This is not only from system POV (efficiency of parsing) but also from a user's. How convenient is to manage a large number of such files and transfer them from one system to another?
* Are there ways to ensure that an org file imported from somewhere else do not run arbitrary commands that are harmful for the system?
* Are there any resources online that does a formal analysis of the source code in terms of efficiency, robustness and stability compared to other task tracking and journaling systems?

Sorry for the long post.  I am hoping to adopt org-mode as my PIM but I want to be sure that if it is worth the effort before I go too far down the rabbit hole.",1578397432.0

Little disclaimer:

* I just started to set up Emacs to work with c++ and I'm relatively new to c++, so if I ask some dumb questions sorry \^\^'.
* This is my work environment so the folder hierarchy of .cpp/.h is not decided by me.
* I remove the name of my workspace in the image and I'll use prj\_\_\_ to refer the workspace.
* I marked on the screenshot the buffer with 1,2,3,4.
* This is my first Reddit post

**Now my issue:**

So I finished with the basic setup and now I have installed llvm (for clang / clangd).

I opened a cpp file in my learning c++ project and lsp asked me the root of the project I set it to  ""e:/workspace/prj\_\_\_"" (Buffer 1)

The issue I have is flycheck throw an error the first line `#include ""ZFraction.h""`, so it does not recognize the whole class I defined.

The error: `Error running timer: (void-function mapcan)`

So I have an error on each occurrence of the class I defined.

When I use ""`lsp-describe-session`"" (buffer 3), I do not see the `ZFraction.h` (buffer 2) I created.

On the screenshot you can see the folder hierarchy (buffer 4).

&#x200B;

In my point of view, it seems that lsp / clang does not find the headers...

I tried to use  `lsp-workspace-folders-add` to add the folder `PublicInterfaces` but it doesn't work :/

&#x200B;

If someone have any tips...

Thanks for reading!

Environment:

* Windows 10
* Emacs 25.1.1
* llvm: 9.0.1

Edit: I forgot the screnshot.

I would like my reporting function to go over all the files in my `org-agenda-files` and for a particular date, extract all the notes (with task names) written on that day.   
Imagine this:

Task 1 has these entries

    ...    
       - State ""DONE""       from ""STARTED""    [2019-12-12 Do 13:14]

         Waiting for MR10 feedback.
    ...

Task 2

    ...
       - State ""REOPEN""     from ""WAIT""       [2019-12-12 Do 16:51] \\
         We got something from the frontend team.

         Waiting for new release from frontend team with the fix.
    ...

If I run my reporting for 2019-12-12, I expect this in a separate buffer:

    * Task 1
       - State ""DONE""       from ""STARTED""    [2019-12-12 Do 13:14]
       - State ""STARTED""    from ""WAIT""       [2019-12-12 Do 13:14]

         We got something from the frontend team.

The notes are taken on the task with `C-c C-z`. 

I know about `org-ql`,but I was not able to form a query that would give me what I want. Mostly because the timestamps in the notes are being ignored and I don't know how to include them.

And yes, my elisp is bad. I kind of get the basics, but not the complicated stuff.

Hey everyone,

I've been reading a ton about personal wiki's, ``org-wiki``, ``org-brain``, etc. 

But it doesn't really sit right with me and I'd like to see if something along those lines is possible :

I have my different courses and lessons in a folder so :

    c:/Users/me/OneDrive/Courses

inside which you can find the following **folders** : 

    - Math
    
    - Stats
    
    - Java
    
    - ...

Each folder has sub folders with slides, books, exercises and notes.

How would I set up an ``org`` file in the parent `/Courses` directory in order to acces the notes, slides and everything in those subfolders without leaving emacs and typing lots of paths with ``C-x C-f`` ? 

In my mind, it'd be set up like :

    #+title: Course Index
    #+author: me
    
    * Introduction
    
    Explanations on how to navigate the file, quick overview of the setup and useful information
    
    ** Math
    
    *** Notes
    
    *** Slides
    
    ** Stats
    
    *** Notes
    
    *** Slides
    
    *** Books
    
    ** Java
    
    *** Notes
    
    *** Code 
    
    ....



Where each header and subheader would let me open the proper dir/files from the ``Course Index`` org file.

Does that setup make sense or should I organize myself differently?

I need advice / links / tips on how to modify a large chunk of text 'automatically' … normally, I would use Regex but Emacs' implementation is IMO underwhelming, to say the least.

         :Entry_Type: Book
         :Author:   Abc

It occurred to me it would be useful to be able to compare a buffer and highlight words which have abbreviations in the abbrevs file, as a 'training' mode to help remember them: i.e. once I'd finished writing a buffer, I'd run the command and note any words for which I could have used an abbreviation -- I'm not bothered whether I actually did use the abbreviation, just that one was available for that particular word.

Does such a command / minor-mode exist? I can't find one.

  Thanks to John Wiegley, Eli Zaretskii, and others who continue guiding the ship toward the best Emacs releases ever.

* Org

  Thanks to Bastien Guerry, Nicolas Goaziou, Kyle Meyer, and--last but certainly not least--Carsten Dominik, the original author, who have made this powerful tool in Emacs that is a significant part of many of our lives today.

* Magit

  Thanks to Jonas Bernoulli and other contributors who have made Magit the most powerful and efficient git porcelain, an indispensable tool!

* Helm and Ivy

  Thanks to Thierry Volpiatto and Oleh Krehel, who have poured their hearts into these powerful UI tools that I couldn't imagine using Emacs without.

* Community

  Thanks to Sacha Chua, the, shall I say, unofficial Emacs ambassador, who has shared Emacs with many new users over the past decade, and continues to be a source of inspiration in the community.

I have been a vim user for over 5 years and I believe I am fairly proficient in vim. About 3 months ago I started using emacs mainly as a note taking tool using org-mode. I now plan on switching to emacs as my main development environment.

1. I want an evil mode centric  setup
2. I have no experience with elisp or any functional languages
3. I need to build and run code (C/C++, Python) on remote machines (my earlier workflow centered around tmux)

When I started I started with doom emacs  but I am questioning if I should just start from scratch.

1. Most things I search on the web is concerned with vanilla emacs
2. Living behind a layer of abstraction makes it difficult to understand what comes from where
3. Doom emacs depends on a single developer for its future

When I used vim, I strictly built my config from scratch, but emacs seems rather overwhelming. I currently struggle to fit into the emacs mindset (The craving to exit and work in the shell takes over)

What is your advice for me?

1. Vanilla / Doom ?
2. Remote editing suggestions ( I am using TRAMP but struggling)

I want emacs python lsp-mode to be able to automatically choose the virtual environment python interpreter for the current project. If not automatically, a manual python interpreter selection would be fine too. Much like the ""Python: Select Interpreter"" option in visual studio code.

To reproduce a sample project for context purposes:
```
$ cd My_Cool_App

$ which python
/usr/bin/python

$ virtualenv cool_venv

$ source cool_venv/bin/activate

(cool_venv) $ which python
/Users/xyz/abc/My_Cool_App/cool_venv/bin/python

Then back in emacs,  I open a python file in that folder. The django module, which I installed locally in this activated virtual environment (cool_venv) seems to be invisible to the lsp-server. And no django-related completions were provided.


There is a workaround to force lsp-server to select the virtual env python interpreter though, and that is to launch emacs ""right here in this CLI instance"":
```
(cool_venv) $ emacs

I had played with it from time to time, but discovering org-mode was the motivation to start climbing the learning curve.

But I'm not STEM anything (by education, vocation, or avocation.) I use Linux, in order of importance to me, for: Freedom, Flexibility, Security, and Stability.

But I am also a hacker (read: tinkerer) by nature and I've decided to up my Emacs-fu(n).  My init is very basic, and has been for years (a theme, a face, org (built-in), org-bullets, neotree (rarely use), ido-mode (just for opening files faster), and todo.txt-mode.

But I want to unleash more of the power of org-mode, ido-mode, learn deft, maybe play with learning Python for my new RaspberryPi, and who knows...maybe elisp if I go crazy.

So, until now my set-up was so simple I never bothered with version control, if that's the right term.  If I changed distros it was trivial to just set up.  I have Emacs on 3 machines (well 2): KDE Neon and Windows 10 (WSL + Ubuntu + X410) on my desktop and openSuse Tumbleweed on my laptop.

At the moment I am not particularly interested in learning git, so I want to put my dotfiles in Dropbox and link to them because I anticipate a more complex init that wouldn't be as easy to replicate manually on each OS.

Question 1: Do all Emacs have to be the same version? I am running 25.\* on Neon and Windows but 26.\* on openSuse.

Question 2: Do I just copy .emacs.d and all sub folders to Dropbox, link to them, and ensure any new packages are also installed there (.emacs.d/elpa and .emacs.d/lisp)? If yes, I can probably figure out how.

Question 3: I have never installed a package using my distro's package manager, but I see them.  Is there a reason to ever do so or is it best to use Melpa?

Question 4: I have only ever used whichever org-mode is built in.  Is there an advantage to using a higher version available in Melpa? 

I just thought of Question 5: I have recently returned to gopherspace and plan on starting a phlog.  I will search, but while I'm asking I might as well ask if there's such a thing as org2phlog, like org2blog? Basically turning links to gophermaps, a heading into an ascii banner, keeping the bold, italics markers as is (which I hide in org-mode, but would be needed in a phlog, etc.)  Probably not because it's such a minor conversion that copy paste suffices.

to cope with this no problem, but there's been a change (and sadly I never really pinpointed it) where

I am trying to remember the name of an Emacs package/project that was previously mentioned on this subreddit before. Here is what I remember:

- It used emacsclient. May have been a wrapper around emacsclient.

- I think it was a shell command. It was used to pipe text into Emacs so that Emacs commands could be run on the piped input. It was almost like a text processing tool.

- It was mentioned previously on this subreddit and it was highly voted.



I know this sounds pretty vague. But, any help is appreciated.

I am wondering if anyone has encountered the same issue and if so, how have you fixed it?

I created that same snippet on that page (only I am using WSL Debian, so it is a bit different).

I called it `notmuch.cmd`, saving it in a directory in PATH.

    debian run %~n0 %*

I was hoping to use Magit in a similar way and after some searching, it seemed as if `magit-file-dispatch` would be an alternative.

>The minor-mode magit-file-mode enables certain Magit features in file-visiting buffers belonging to a Git repository.

I rebound `magit-file-dispatch` to `C-c g` and started trying it -- but there is some behaviour that seems counter-intuitive. I just want to check if it is behaving as intended or whether I have something wrong with my setup.

I assumed that `C-c g c c` would do roughly the same thing as `C-x v v`. However, there are some significant differences and I am wondering if they are by design -- and if so, whether there is a way to attain what I want.

Assuming I have some unsaved files in the repository, the differences are as follows:

* Using `C-c g c c`: Magit prompts to save unsaved files. This is already annoying, but if I accept the prompt and save the unsaved files Magit then prompts me with ""Nothing staged. Stage and commit **all** unstaged changes?"" This seems very odd for something that is supposed to act only on the current buffer/file.
* Using `C-c g s`: Magit prompts to save unsaved files. Then it stages only the current buffer/file.
* Using `C-c g s` followed by `C-c g c c`: Magit prompts to save unsaved files. More importantly, this combination of keystrokes defeats the purpose of have a lightweight, fast way to commit a minor change to a specific file.

So, is this the way Magit's `magit-file-dispatch` is supposed to work?

If so, is there a way to get what I want using Magit: do a quick stage + commit of the current file/buffer (preferably without having to save all other unsaved files)?

In case it makes a difference, this is my current setup: Magit 20191227.1438, Git 2.20.1, Emacs 28.0.50, gnu/linux.",1577887990.0

I use buffer-mode.el from MELPA and the built-in windmove commands.

Here's my global key config:

Desmesura,"Should Elisp Programs use the ""Kill-Ring""?",0.88,False,False,6,ei7dwt,emacs,https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/ei7dwt/should_elisp_programs_use_the_killring/,6,"That's basically the question. Is it good practice for Elisp programs to use the `kill-ring` (or the `mark-ring` even)? Or is it better if they use their own variables (for storing text and positions), so the user's `kill-ring` and `mark-ring` doesn't get modified?

I mean, of course, **when the User doesn't really need to know the internals** of those programs (black box). I don't mean, for example, a function designed to explicitly add things to your `kill-ring` so you can later copy them.

I ask because [in this exercise](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eintr/Looping-exercise.html#Looping-exercise) (the last one) of **Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp**, it tells you to use killing and yanking procedures for your function. My idea would be to use variables instead of the `kill-ring` (killing/yanking).

What do you think?",1577848530.0
